If you are looking for a short explanation of the Post :

The outer arm spins around at a speed, precisely œÄ times faster than the inner arm. But because œÄ is this never-ending, irrational number, that outer arm will never, ever stop at its starting point, no matter how long the video goes on. It's like a forever chase scene where the arm always misses the target line by the tiniest bit, and that bit is basically as thin as it gets.

"AI Music, explained with Grimes and Spotify's CEO",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey75Xw_ikqs,Cleo Abram,News & Politics,[''],2023-11-08T01:48:01.488Z,"When should artists get paid in a world with AI music?

Artificial intelligence is changing how music gets made - and how musicians get paid. AI is letting people clone artists‚Äô voices, create completely new songs as fake collaborations, generate lyrics in seconds, even produce full tracks just by typing in a few words. It‚Äôs all causing some to say AI will be ‚Äúthe death of music.‚Äù

Technology causes turning points in history. And I think we‚Äôre in one right now for music. The stakes are high: If we get this wrong, we could jeopardize how human musicians make money and art. But if we get it right, we have an opportunity to leap ahead in how we as humans get to express ourselves. 

To really understand what‚Äôs happening with AI music, you need to understand how the music industry ALREADY works  - and how it could be changing. In this video, I took a deep dive into that topic with the help of two people right in the thick of it: The artist Grimes and CEO of Spotify Daniel Ek. 

Chapters: 
00:00 What is happening with AI in music?
02:05 Why would we want AI music?
04:03 How are musicians using AI?
06:17 When should musicians get paid?
07:15 What is copying versus inspiration?
08:26 How does copyright work in music?
10:06 Should artists get paid for AI training on their music?
11:55 What happens when AI generates its own songs?
12:54 How could AI music be ""huge if true""?

In this video I walked around a few places and documented my experience and gave each location a rating. In certain parts of the Documentary, My Visual Effects team used Green Screen and CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) to simulate smoke, for comedic effect and expression. There are is no real smoke in this video, and every viewer of the Documentary knows this. This is not the main focus of the video, just as a comedic expression in this larger Documentary. My special effects team works hard to make everything realistic, while leaving a hint of artistic expression, to make the smoke simulations noticeably fake.

How Gawx Art became the Best YouTuber,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktd5W7QIsmg,Bruno Kay,People & Blogs,"['Gawx art', 'Gawx art 2', 'How Gawx Art became the Best YouTuber', 'paddy galloway', 'genius strategy', 'tyler fleischmann', 'Making My Biggest Painting Ever!', 'Painting my House While my Parents are Away!', 'youtube analysis', 'mrbeast', 'gxace', 'Bruno Kay']",2023-11-07T22:22:55.457Z,"Gawx Art is arguably the best YouTuber on the platform.
I‚Äôm saying this because his video production quality is unlike anything I‚Äôve ever seen before on YouTube. Even though his channel isn‚Äôt about filmmaking, his videos are better than many of the filmmaking YouTubers out there. 
The fact that every single brand wants to work with him and be associated with him, confirms that he is such a high quality YouTuber. His channel is almost at 2 million subscribers and his content is absolutely loved by his fans to a degree that is rarely seen on YouTube.
I watched and analysed a lot of his content and have broken it down into 4 reasons for how Gawx became and is the Best Youtuber.

Emulating Games is Amazing and You Should be Doing it,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCTAVbWdS5o,Pariah695,Gaming,"['Emulation', 'PC', 'Hack', 'Tip', 'Retroarch', 'Dolphin', 'Guide']",2023-11-07T19:29:50.448Z,"Hope this video is helpful to people. And yes. There was a noticeable Genesis bias in this video. What of it?

I certainly don't know everything there is to know about emulation. In fact, I learned some new things in the process of making this video. If there's anything I got wrong or forgot to mention, please let me know in the comments.

One thing I did forget is it's usually a good idea to check out romhacking(dot)net when playing anything on a cartridge. There's usually good enhancement hacks out there. I've included that and some easy to use patchers in the links below.

I would also like to give some props to good official emulation, what little of it there is. Xbox has done an awesome job providing great ways to play classic games with their backward compatibility stuff. They provide the kinds of enhances you never see in official emulation. And you can even use the original discs. Most of the time, the best way to play old Xbox stuff is on the consoles. Which is how it should be.

Also that recent TMNT Cowabunga Collection is by far the best classic game collection I've ever seen. That's the kind of thing old games deserve. I was really blown away by that.

I guess it is worth mention that Switch emulation is a thing. But I have yet to look into it and don't know how far along those are. From what I can tell, you can't do things like enhance frame rates and stuff, which is what I'm really after.

Here's all the links. Some in the comments have informed me that MelonDS is a better DS emulator these days. So try that as well.

Are gaming pens the future instead of mice? Drawing tablet to reach Immortal in Valorant ft.

That's what Kariyu managed to do, so I jumped on a call with him to talk about what it could mean for the future of gaming.

I started this channel because I realized I could aim better with smaller mice and wanted to share the experience... and I've found that having a thinner grip width, along with lower button height really helps aim. So what if we used something even smaller like a pen?

Kariyu has some answers, so hope you enjoy the chat!

In this episode, you'll learn how to make a mechanical keyboard start to finish, and how to choose everything that goes into it. I explain which keyswitches to use, how to figure out which layout is right for you, and what software to prepare. I finish by building a 3D printed 60% mechanical keyboard start to finish, and things only get a little lewd.

My build is a SiCK-68 60% mechanical keyboard, with Kailh Box Jade keyswitches, Costar stabilizers, and questionable keycaps from Amazon. I didn't show the USB cable, but it's a pink paracord-wrapped mini USB dealio from 1UP.

I‚Äôve been a pretty dedicated Windows user for about 15 years now but for many many reasons, I decided to switch to a Mac. A M1 Macbook Pro 14. I didn't expect much. But holy damn. 

It's been one year I can quite honestly say that it has changed my life. Never in my life did I think I‚Äôd find myself saying that. This video will go into a bit about my journey with both Windows and Mac and why in my OPINION, I'll stay with one for a very very long time. It's not really a review, but I hope I could provide you with a good story, and of course - some memes.

Most business owners would think that if they market their products or services, they need to shell out money for Facebook ads, YouTube ads, paid search, and even going as far as asking a social media influencer to talk about their product.

It is possible! You just have to look at some ways that I guarantee would not require you to pay anything!

If you're interested in making music, this is the best place to start!  I'm going to teach you the best formula for producing professional sounding music - anyone can do this if you have a computer!  Music production for beginners can seem overwhelming, but I've broken everything down into bite size pieces that you can remember and apply! 

Let me know if you have an questions or feedback down in the comments!!

The TRUTH About Getting Into Music Production in 2023,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX_WOzXjdXY,Ethan Davis,Education,"['music production', 'production', 'producing music', 'music production 2023', 'ableton tutorial', 'ableton live 11 tutorial', 'ableton', 'ableton live', 'ethan davis', 'fl studio', 'music producer']",2023-11-07T01:43:53.027Z,"Here's part of the course for free if you're interested: https://www.completeproducerpro.com/register

Okay so there's a huge lie floating around that stops most people before they even start when it comes to producing music.  And it pisses me off because it's NOT TRUE.  The reality is, whether you think you can, or think you can't, you're right.  Most people believe they can't, and that's the only reason they don't make music.  99% of people are capable of creating great music, and the only thing stopping them is their belief...or lack thereof. 

Thanks for watching!!

Cheers"

"Razer Blade 16 review: A dual-mode display marvel, but it can‚Äôt beat the Blade 15",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cutDcayj0P0,Engadget,Science & Technology,"['engadget', 'technology', 'consumer tech', 'gadgets', 'science', 'gear', 'tech', 'Review', 'Razer Blade 16', 'Razer', 'Razer Laptops', 'Razer Blade Laptops', 'Best gaming laptops', 'best razer laptops', 'gaming razer laptops', 'razer blade 18', 'razer mini LED']",2023-11-06T16:55:33.512Z,"The Razer Blade 16 features one of the most unique laptop displays we‚Äôve ever seen: It can switch between native 1080p and 4K modes. Coupled with Intel‚Äôs latest 13th-gen CPU and NVIDIA‚Äôs most powerful RTX 40-series GPUs, it‚Äôs also one of the most powerful machines in Razer‚Äôs lineup. But its high price ($3,300 with the dual-mode) display and added heft make it less practical than the tried and true Blade 15.

Price: $2,700
Pros: Groundbreaking dual-mode 4K/1080 display, Tons of power, All the ports you need, Bright MiniLED backlight, Excellent keyboard and trackpad
Cons: Expensive if you want the dual-mode screen, Noticeably bulkier than the Blade 15

""Filthy Animal."" - Pulp Fiction (1994) #shorts #pulpfiction #movie #quentintarantino

Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino from a story he conceived with Roger Avary. It tells four intertwining tales of crime and violence in Los Angeles, California. The film stars John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman. The title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.

Lyrics:
My brother has a better house than I do 
Bigger yard and a swimming pool
My brother has a family of his own 
They don‚Äôt see him like they see me 
Never been disowned 

But ain‚Äôt no high like this one
Ain‚Äôt no high like this 
Ain‚Äôt no high like this one 
Ain‚Äôt no high like this 
Ain‚Äôt no high like this  one 
Ain‚Äôt no high like this 
Ain‚Äôt no high like this one 
Ain‚Äôt no high like this 

My sister, Is given Risperidone for all of the feelings
That she can't, Control my Father didn't know
What to do, Sitting there in the Hospital
He bought, Me there so she'd see my face
Then the next day, We brought her home
Ain't no high, Like this one ain't no high like this
Ain't no high, Like this one ain't no high like this

Ain‚Äôt no high like this one 
Ain‚Äôt no high like this 
Ain‚Äôt no high like this  one 
Ain‚Äôt no high like this 
Ain‚Äôt no high like this one 
Ain‚Äôt no high like this 

I‚Äôm too OD, I need to chill
I‚Äôll never know, How cold that turkey feels
You saw me, Cry and it wasn't for help this is
The best thing, That I've ever felt can't get it back
So how time, Supposed to heal who can hurt me
More than I, Hurt myself you can't hurt me more 
Than I hurt myself, You can't hurt me more than
I've hurt myself

lyrics:
My favorite poem was the one I read to you
From the teleprompter on the tongue of my shoe
My flashbacks are a touch more resolute
Declaring thumb wars in the pocket of my suit

Take it
Take it all down, take me all apart
You can have my tongue just promise you‚Äôll take it a la carte yeah
Take it all, just don‚Äôt take it all to heart
Thank God we turned the lights off, thank God

Take it, uh
Take me all apart
You can have my tongue just promise you‚Äôll take it a la carte
Take it all, just don‚Äôt take it all to heart
Thank God we turned the lights off, thank God

And what I never knew
I‚Äôd rather be inside my head than you
How many times? Well I couldn‚Äôt count
Cause it gets so deep, it goes so deep I‚Äôm never pulling out

NYC on a red eye free cause they wanna take this and that
LLC for the next LP and I‚Äôm never gonna give it back
Sleep deprived on my return flight, fixated bout my hold on you
I don‚Äôt usually care for the doom in the air but it‚Äôs feeling kinda overdue, yeah

My favorite poem‚Äôs what I couldn‚Äôt say to you
The joke that wasn‚Äôt funny cause it‚Äôs true
My flashbacks are a touch more resolute
So forgive me for the hesitant salute

Take it
Take it all down, take me all apart
You can have my tongue if you take it a la carte
Take it all, just don‚Äôt take it all to heart
Thank God we turned the lights off, thank God

Uh, and what I never knew
I‚Äôd rather be inside my head than you
How many times? I couldn‚Äôt count
Cause it gets so deep I go so deep I‚Äôm never pulling out

(brakence)
Took you south,
Guess I got my jaw agape now I‚Äôm a cotton mouth,
Why do I feel so unsafe? What am I worried bout
Got a sedated sipping 80 proof
Skip the winter season like it‚Äôs pay-per-view
It ain‚Äôt you, I‚Äôm just caught up in my own sh*, licking wounds
I know it isn‚Äôt state of the art but the plate‚Äôs a la carte
Would you like course two?
(I don‚Äôt really think I‚Äôm perfect)
And what I never knew
(I don‚Äôt really think I‚Äôm, I don‚Äôt really think I‚Äôm perfect)
Could-could I be inside my head with you?
Freaked out tryna f*** you right
I know you never grade looks, still feel like a five,
But you said if we make love and I start to cry that
I can let it all out, shouldn‚Äôt rationalize but
God damn,
Do I deserve that you can‚Äôt hear me now?
It just gets so deep, and it goes so deep now that I‚Äôm peering down

My favorite poem was the one I read to you,
On the tongue of my shoe
Flashbacks are a touch more resolute
So forgive me
So please forgive me ohhh
Take me all apart
You can have my tongue if you take it a la carte
Take it all, just don‚Äôt take it all to heart"

Uh, if he fall on that floor, let him go,‚Åügone
Niggas‚Åüain't‚Åübuilt for this‚Åüpage in my‚Åüarc
All this Champagne put a stain on my heart
Don't pick him up, he ain't built for this part
If you wasn't here for them lows, walk
Blick on my hip and I'm dressed like a God
Labels like burners, just use 'em to toss
I take a shot and like Moses they part
Man, I can't tell what you mean (Huh)
Why does your black feel like business to me?
Industry lies never line up on screen (Facts)
Peggy keep scoring, I feel like the Dream
Yeah, what you want, ugh
Y'all love the fake, I've been real from the start
Never hesitate to shoot at a star
Stocked up on weapons and pussy and cars
Just thought you should know, ugh
Look at this lane that I made, it was vacant
These veggie grill niggas don't really want beef
Real niggas dying and fakers replace 'em
Now I see my DNA all in y'all beats
Talk, niggas just rap, don't back up what they talk
Pray for me, got so much smoke in my heart
Rap like I'm gifted and grew up on guard, yeah
Shorty want dick (What?), money, and leverage
One out of three, feel like three when I'm in it (Skrrt)
Peggy the G.O.A.T., more like the feds
As soon as you see me you know that it's finished
And, how can you tell that he's winnin'? (How?)
Floated right through the pandemic, no limits
Stunted creatively, don't got a vision
I die for my pride, you be hiding in gimmicks
Glock with a switch, turn a vegan to spinach (Brrt)
PM-50, we ain't beefin', you dinner
Turn a ""I'll do it"" right into ""Who did it?""
Some you can't speak, you should just buy a ticket
Choke 'em to death with the smoke from this fye
Giving these alt niggas hope when I die
Call up my mama then hang up the line (Bitch)
Money got me feelin' white like I'm Thai
Hawk!
When I go out tell 'em Peggy ain't give up, he fought, fuck 'em!

Whether you're a graphic designer, video editor, photographer, 3D modeling enthusiast, architect, or an After Effects user, this video is for you. We're here to help you decide whether to invest your budget in a creator-focused laptop like the Asus ZenBook Pro 16X or opt for a more powerful gaming laptop. Let's break down the pros and cons of each option to guide you in making the right choice.

Performance and Form Factor

Before we delve into the specifics, it's crucial to understand that as a creative professional, your laptop should pack some serious punch. The Asus ZenBook Pro 16X is a powerful machine equipped with an RTX 4080, an i9-13905H processor, and 32GB of RAM, all neatly packaged in a relatively lightweight design, considering its capabilities. However, it's not an Ultrabook, and for tasks like video editing, 3D modeling, Blender, and After Effects, you'll want a laptop with a dedicated GPU and a robust H-series processor.

In contrast, gaming laptops tend to be bulkier and have a more gamer-centric aesthetic. For instance, the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i boasts an i9-13900HX, an RTX 4070, and 32GB of RAM, providing impressive performance at a slightly lower price point. The Asus Republic of Gamers Strix Scar 17, on the other hand, is the heaviest and chunkiest of the three, sporting an RTX 4090 at a similar price to the ZenBook Pro 16X. So, if you prefer a sleek and premium design, the ZenBook is your pick, while those leaning toward maximum performance may opt for one of the gaming laptops.

In conclusion, the best laptop for you depends on your priorities. If you value a sleek design, premium features like the ASUS Dial and haptic trackpad, and impressive battery life without compromising on performance, the ZenBook Pro 16X is a top contender. However, if you require maximum raw power for tasks like 8K video editing and don't mind a bulkier design, gaming laptops like the Strix Scar or Legion Pro 7i are excellent options.

Be sure to check the links in the description for pricing details and consider your specific needs when making your purchase decision. Whichever laptop you choose, you're well-equipped to tackle your creative projects with confidence.

Boasting a 13th Gen Intel processor, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 GPU and PureSight Pro display, the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i is beefy enough for video editing and gaming. Yet this 14 or 16-inch notebook is also impressively portable, making it an ideal alternative to Apple's Macbook Pro.

Gamers and creators will love the Intel 13th Gen power, backed by an RTX 4000-series GPU so editing and online deathmatching are silky smooth. The Lenovo Slim Pro 9i remains impressively quiet despite the next-gen performance, while that slender chassis is easy to slip inside a backpack.

You get a 3k display on this 14-inch model, upgraded to 3.2k in the 16-incher. The Yoga Pro 9i also serves up some beefy speakers, a well designed keyboard, privacy webcam and loads of great features.

from ""the first glass beach album"" available here:
https://glassbeach.bandcamp.com/album/the-first-glass-beach-album

lyrics:
here it is again, a heart of excitement 
in the form of a girl who hates her life 
as she sits alone on the floor of her bedroom 
waiting for answers, wasting time 

here it is again, the son of a soldier, 
remington shotgun, rolled up sleeves 
to keep satan out of the walls of the suburbs 
his last bastion of modernity 

but satan waits upstairs, watching over his daughter 
she writes emo songs, she's so depressed 
her lyrics are naive but she still sings her heart out 
the only way she knows how to confess 

and as she gets up to shut the bedroom door behind her 
he stands right beside her, she's trying to get her head on straight 
with box dye hair to match her black thigh highs 
and scratched nail polish, she performs feminity 
she laughs so hard i watch her lose her balance, fall over backwards 
to the arms of mephistopheles 
but she'll never leave her bedroom in this bedroom community 

you'll never be ok, k, if you don't come to your senses 
with you everythings the end of the world 
melancholia can spread like a virus 
I'm sure you got it from that stupid girl 

you'll never be ok, if you don't come to your senses 
but I feel so defenseless, so alone 
i thought he was right when he said that he loved me 
he's still thinking of me from up there 

and as they stop to look at her they won't look further, 
like it's not a murder, it's an inevitable tragedy 
the bloody hands of all the heartless fuckers 
who emotionally fucked her to monetize her suffering 
flipping through a spiral notebook for some 
sad hopeless words to turn into a liturgy 
so she'll never leave her bedroom in this bedroom community 

da na na na naaa 
na na na na na 
na na na na na 
na na na. 
na na na na NA na 
NAA nana na na 
na na na na na 
na na na. 

no no no no no no no no no no 
no no NO no, no no no no 
nonono no no NO no 
no no no no no no 
no NO NO NO, no no no no 
nonono no no NO no 
no no no no no no no no no no 
no nooo NO no, no no no no 
nonono no no NO no 
no we'll never leave our bedrooms, 
we're a bedroom community 

here it is again, a heart of excitement 
in the form of a girl who hates her life 
as she sits alone on the floor of her bedroom 
waiting for answers, wasting time"

ùÑû If I had not allowed myself to get into the tedium of over working and analyzing this LoFi tune I probably would not have created and discovered this texture: Many monophonic synths all gliding to and from chord tones in a slippery choir. My beat morphed from J Dilla into Snarky Puppy. This video tells the 2 year story of how I may have ruined a perfectly good Lofi Hiphop instrumental track with complexity. Maybe for the better, maybe for the worse. In April of 2021 I used the midi connectivity of the Yamaha Electone HX-1 organ to record improvisations into Ableton Live. I found it difficult to accept the simple creative ideas I was improvising for what they were. There was always the lingering feeling that further editing and crafting would turn a good musical idea into a great one. This can be a major obstacle because it prevents me from accessing the deceptive simplicity exemplified in the music of Fred Again, Ben Bohmer, J Dilla, Floating Points, Fourtet, Wayne Shorter, Ahmad Jamal, Henry Mancini, Paul Desmond, Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock and countless others. Often times I create a musical idea that is satisfying on some level, but if it is on the simpler side, I‚Äôll jump into a pattern of habitually complicating the idea; often losing the original essence in the pursuit of greater technical indulgences. In this video I will show you one such scenario; how I took a nice Lofi Hiphop instrumental improvisation and ruined it by blindly reaching for complexity. ùÑ¢

Projektor is an alias I started around august 2019. Under this alias I started posting psytrance music with a clear emphasis on theming and a more progressive or mainstream style than other producers. The goal of the Projektor alias is to release memorable music which works well on the dancefloor. Around january 2020 I started posting tutorials and other helpful videos on youtube again under the Projektor alias. Together with these videos I started selling several products which can be used to improve your productions. I have always believed music production knowledge should be shared and that is now one of my main goals with the Projektor alias. Currently Projektor is the only alias under which I release music, videos or products but this might change in the future!

Human vs A.I. Art,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSszOxJiP0Q,magnify,Entertainment,"['art history', 'fun facts', 'midjourney', 'artificial intelligence', 'bible study']",2023-11-05T13:09:29.297Z,"John Martin's ""Seventh Plague of Egypt"" is a masterclass in evoking drama through contrast. It expertly juxtaposes the divine with the mortal, the natural with the engineered, and light with darkness. The composition is not just a visual representation but also an emotional and philosophical commentary on themes like faith, hubris, and destiny. A.I. art platforms like midjourney, while technologically sophisticated, often grapple with recreating such poetic and dramatic contrasts. Their algorithms are primarily driven by patterns and data, which makes it challenging to imbue the depth of perception and nuanced symbolism found in human-created art."

You will learn how to create the gritty, lo-fi beats that are a hallmark of Cities Aviv's sound, as well as how to incorporate unconventional samples, vocal manipulation, and effects to give your beats a distinct and experimental edge. We'll also cover how to layer drums and samples to create a thick, driving rhythm section, as well as how to use automation and other production techniques to add movement and tension to your tracks. This tutorial is perfect for anyone looking to add some edge and experimentation to their hip-hop production, or for fans of Cities Aviv looking to learn more about the artist's creative process. We'll walk you through the process of creating a full track, from the initial idea to the final mixdown, so you can see the full production process. So, whether you're a beginner or an experienced producer, grab your DAW and start creating your own Cities Aviv-inspired beats today!

Massive disclaimer-- I don't make these videos to claim that I am 100% accurate in replicating the artist's music production style. I make these videos in hopes to teach you on how I think he makes his music. This is to educate you to share new techniques that you might not have come across to put into your own music.

Yo! Today, we're going to be stepping out of our comfort zones and exploring a new genre - deep house! As a hip hop producer, I know it can be easy to get stuck in the same patterns and stick to what we know. But that's exactly why it's so important to challenge ourselves and try new things.

Stepping outside of your comfort zone is a great way to grow as a producer and musician. It's a chance to explore new sounds, try new techniques, and challenge yourself to create something truly unique.

Did I succeed? I personally think I failed this one!

Howdy doody, frienderoonies! Today we're here for some sound design fun using UVI Falcon 2 to create some awesome cinematic drums using only some noise and a bit of clever processing! 

This trick can be done in any DAW with any synth that offers noise and a filter, so feel free to follow along with Serum, Vital, or whatever your synth of choice may be. 

This is a super fun way to add some huge drums to your next track or just some general cinematic flair to your next build up or intro or whatever you might be doing.

JPEGMAFIA & Danny Brown - Steppa Pig (Dynamic Edit),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix_Y5ox-ayU,Dynamic Editor,Music,"['loudness war', 'declipped', 'declip', 'dynamic', 'dynamic edit', 'remaster', 'remastered', 'unmastered', 'clipped', 'clipping', 'compression', 'compressed', 'audiophile']",2023-11-04T23:35:14.342Z,"This is what I like to call a ‚Äòdynamic edit‚Äô of ‚ÄúSteppa Pig‚Äù by JPEGMAFIA and Danny Brown! Whether intended or otherwise, _Scaring the Hoes_ faces a VERY heavy amount of dynamic range compression (not to be confused with data compression, which concerns MP3s and such) in its final release, resulting in a heavy amount of distortion of‚Ä¶ well, basically the whole project. In this, I attempt to undo that mastering compression and resulting distortion, making the music more dynamic and perhaps, easier to listen to!

For those not in the know, the Loudness War is a phenomenon beginning in the mid-90s onward, in which music was mastered louder and louder, with the underlying reasoning being that louder music sounds better, and thus, should sell better. As with any medium, however, there is a peak loudness a signal can reach, so dynamic range compression (which makes the louder parts of the signal quieter while keeping the quiet parts the same loudness) and sometimes even clipping (attempting to make a signal louder than maximum loudness) were used to make music as loud as possible.

The issue with this is that overuse of dynamic range compression and clipping can make music fatiguing to listen to, and sometimes even audibly distorted. Additionally, clipping, poor compressors, or overuse of compressors can result in artifacts such as hiss or crackle being audible atop the signal. Both are present all over _Scaring the Hoes._

While most loud masterings of albums I find are detrimental to the album‚Äôs final sound, such as the heavy clipping on Jay-Z‚Äôs _The Black Album,_ the final master of _Scaring the Hoes_ gives me pause. The album as a whole, regardless of its heavy compression, leans moreso towards scrappiness than opulence, so what‚Äôs wrong with a clipped sound to it all? ‚ÄúSteppa Pig‚Äù hits you with an almost psychedelic punch with its distorted beats, and ‚ÄúSCARING THE HOES‚Äù creates an eerie atmosphere from its monstrous, compressed bass tone. On the other hand, I feel that the second half of ‚ÄúShut Yo Bitch Ass Up / Muddy Waters‚Äù loses much of its swing from its beat not being able to cut though well, and ‚ÄúGod Loves You‚Äù is mastered so loudly that it sounds stilted, with its beat sounding like it suddenly auto-ducks the rest of the instrumental.

With how clipped the final release is, I can‚Äôt see this album being so loud as distorted as anything but an intentional choice by JPEGMAFIA and/or Danny Brown. Even mastering engineers infamously known for creating loud and distorted masters, such as Howie Weinberg and Vlado Meller, don‚Äôt master albums this loudly, so I imagine the mastering engineer of _Scaring the Hoes_ (Dale Becker) was either given a highly clipped and distorted release to begin with, or was instructed to _make_ it that clipped and distorted.

I attempted to undo the heavy dynamic range compression on this album with a program called ‚ÄúPerfect Declipper‚Äù, which can not only affect clipping, but other types of compression found in mastering as well! It can also undo much of the distortion from that compression, as you can probably hear when you listen! Though these edits, I was able to bring the dynamic range of the album from 2 to 12, which hopefully makes it easier to listen to.

It‚Äôs important to note that the dynamics are not being restored with the ‚ÄúPerfect Declipper‚Äù program that I use, but rather, they are being approximated. While one may not be able to ‚Äúdeclip‚Äù an album as one would be unable to ‚Äúunbake a cake‚Äù, I find the results here to be a convincible attempt at doing so. Only in the most extreme examples have I heard the program produce odd artifacts that would appear unintended in the album‚Äôs mix.

I also want to make clear that dynamic range compression is not an inherently bad thing. It can tighten up performances, add grit, and help remove dynamic outliers that would take you out of the mix. Additionally, mastering engineers are often underneath the implicit and explicit pressures of artists and record labels to master albums loudly, so the results of mastering may not necessarily reflect a mastering engineer‚Äôs intentions for how they wanted an album to sound. Also, whether my edits sound better than the original release is up to what the listener thinks!

I produce many more dynamic edits on this channel as well as further descriptions in posts over on Reddit! You can look at this for a full list of the albums I‚Äôve done: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1975IIQohEqbV-iZOSCWD0Cupbk0kGn3l5MgzB_ZCwQ8

Info about me:
I produce pretty much just house music, getting inspiration from mainly from Avicii, Jakob Liedholm(jaakob), just to name a few. I have my whole life in some way been passionate about music! During childhood I tried taking piano lessons, but it felt forced and unnatural with having organized lesson - so to speak. Then at the beginning of my teens I found out about FL Studio, and instantly knew that this was right! After some years back and forth with music, I'm here ready to improve and starting my career as a musician!"

Secondary dominant chords are used in almost all styles of music and are a very useful concept to get your head around. Whether it's Billie Eilish or The Beatles, Bob Dylan or Bohemian Rhapsody, we can find secondary dominant chords at work.

i don't wanna get involved but you got me
i don't wanna get involved but you got me
you got me, you got me

The Winstons - Amen, Brother ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winstons )

Wikipedia Source:
""The Winstons were a 1960s funk and soul music group, based in Washington, D.C.. They are known for their 1969 recording of an EP featuring a song entitled ""Color Him Father"" on the A-side, and a song entitled ""Amen, Brother"" on the B-side. Half-way into ""Amen, Brother"", there is a drum solo (performed by G.C. Coleman) which would cause The Winston's EP to become one of the most widely-sampled records in the history of electronic music. Sampled audio clips of the drum solo became known as the Amen Break, which has been used in thousands of tracks in a large number of musical genres, including drum and bass, hip hop, jungle, big beat, industrial and electronica.

The ""Color Him Father"" record sold over one million copies, and received a gold record awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America on 24 July 1969.""


Label : (Metromedia Records, BMI) 


Biography by Ron Wynn & Bruce Eder :
A Washington, D.C.-based soul act led by Richard Spencer, the Winstons signed to Curtom in early 1968 and lasted there for one single, the rousing ""Need a Replacement."" They had a sound that was somewhat similar to the Impressions, but were unfortunate enough to have signed with Curtom before the label had national distribution, and the single never got the play it should have. A year after leaving Curtom, they hit for the Metromedia label with a huge single called ""Color Him Father,"" which became a Top Ten R&B and pop hit, just missing number one on the R&B list, and also earned a Grammy for Best R&B Song. It was both a great tribute number and outstanding lead vocal from Richard Spencer, along with Ray Maritano, Quincy Mattison, Phil Tolotta, Sonny Peckrol, and G.C. Coleman. Mattison and Coleman were veterans of Otis Redding's band. The Winstons eventually toured as the backup band for the Impressions, but never again made any noise on the charts. 

 The Winstons line-up included:

Gregory C. Coleman (vocals, drums)
Ray Maritano (vocals, alto saxophone)
Quincy Mattison (vocals, lead guitar)
Sonny Pekerol (vocals, bass guitar)
Richard Lewis Spencer (lead vocals, tenor saxophone)
Phil Tolotta (second lead, organ)

someones out of hiding
try and wait try and see
who's the one abiding
never late
i know that im the one whos fighting
every time i feel the pain
is not subsiding
killing me, digging in
deeper as i fall in
empty breath, nothing to see
im just a dumb kid, nothing left
only to see me tearing up when
im alone only to
tease me when im up
all on my own

im forced here to run away how
i see things now
its too late im
sure youll hate my
thoughts are sinking
please stop thinking
im so wrong when
im not broken

im face to face with death
still choking on your breath
my fear is in your eyes
and you just take your step to take my life

"Why Isometric? | Art, Code and Matrix Maths | A Devlog",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fZXlxtMbC0,Wintermute Digital,Film & Animation,"['art', 'indie game', 'gamedev', 'development', 'code', 'math']",2023-11-03T16:40:50.732Z,"This indie game development log (devlog) explains the high level concept, a method to make near perfect pixel art isometric tiles, the linear algebra of transformation matrices and the code changes and considerations you need when converting a game to an isometric format. 

There's just something special about isometric games. They capture the retro feel of using 2D graphics to display a 3D world, in a time where immense, billion polygon 3D landscapes are now industry standard. 

Join me for a dive into pixel ratios, matrix multiplications, and theoretically perfect but realistically rather buggy code.

--- Note --- Feedback on programming is appreciated! If you don't know how to code, that's alright, my explanation of the maths is much more technical. Linear algebra is quite cool! Do not take coding advice from me, I am definitely not an expert :) ---

I'll be showing you how to play the finals beta and delivering some more gameplay.

To play The Finals beta simply go to the store on your device, be it on steam, xbox store of the playstation store and register for the beta, download and go. This is the first crossplay beta for The Finals so it's open to everybody.

There is currently a queue for the Finals open beta so you'll have to wait to get access. The game is super popular which is great to see and totally understandable. The servers have been crashing due to the unforseen popularity of this game and there is also the login error code 500 popping up on steam. Just keep trying and eventually it will work.

The Finals open beta period starts on October 26, and runs through to November 5.

The Finals has added new content as part of the open beta period including the new map Skyway Stadium (new), a new mode, as well as the classic game mode cashout on Monaco and Seoul.

This gameplay is a new review and first impressions of the Finals and is not sponsored, it is my honest first-hand experience and opinion on how the game feels.

In this video, we take a closer look at the Monduo 14-inch model, the latest addition to Monduo's innovative lineup of portable multi-screen solutions. Earlier this year, MKBHD gave the Monduo 16 a near-perfect score, and now we have the Monduo 14-inch model before us, boasting an aluminum chassis, glass displays, 500 nits of screen brightness, and 100% DCI-P3 color accuracy. What sets this model apart is its improved port connectivity and the ability to extend your laptop's screen across all three displays, a feature previously unheard of. Join us as we unbox and set up this sleek and lightweight aluminum build, offering a substantial increase in screen real estate without sacrificing portability.

The Monduo 14-inch model not only impresses with its premium build quality but also introduces an ingenious cable management design, making it effortless to set up. You'll find an array of cables, including HDMI to mini HDMI and multiple USB Type-C cords for various connection options. What's remarkable is that the Monduo can be powered directly through USB Type-C, eliminating the need for an external power brick. We demonstrate the quick and easy setup on the Asus Republic of Gamers Zephyrus G14, highlighting the improved base plate placement for a seamless and clutter-free experience.

Apple is pushing the forefront of the MacBook Pro lineup by supercharging them with the next-generation M2 Max chips, and it has inspired ASUS to enter the fray.

Lyrics:

Don‚Äôt try to make yourself remember, darling
Don‚Äôt look for me, I‚Äôm just a story you‚Äôve been told
So let‚Äôs pretend a little longer
Cause when we‚Äôre gone,
Everything goes on

Well, you were staring at the window
And I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just bring the sea to you‚Äù

But if I was gone tomorrow,
Won‚Äôt the waves crash on?
Is it selfish that I‚Äôm happy,
As we pass the setting sun?
Someday I‚Äôll be overcast,
But you won‚Äôt have to cry -
Cause we‚Äôll do the grieving
While I‚Äôm by your side
I said:

Don‚Äôt try to make yourself remember, darling
Don‚Äôt look for me, I‚Äôm just a story you‚Äôve been told
So let‚Äôs pretend a little longer
Cause when we‚Äôre gone,
Everything goes on

And I‚Äôm so scared of getting used to this
All the vines that keep you tethered in your room
Said, ""I‚Äôm sorry that you worried""
But don‚Äôt apologize
I told you to forget me
But you stayed by my side
When I said:

""Don‚Äôt try to make yourself remember, darling
Don‚Äôt look for me, I‚Äôm just a story you‚Äôve been told""
So let‚Äôs pretend a little longer
And when we‚Äôre gone,
Everything goes on

The ASUS Zenbook Pro 16x just might be the best Windows laptop I've tried so far! Not only is it silly powerful, but it's also reasonable thin, light and silent when on battery (doing everyday tasks!) so it really feels like a laptop of two halves. It's all the power you need when you need it, but chill when you don't! 

Now we just need the battery life to keep getting better!

ASUS Zenbooks have been tailored more to creative or daily use, but the Pro versions take it to a new level. The 14 Duo has two screens one OLED, while the 16X has a giant OLED screen and a knob! So if you want to flex on Apple users, this is probably your best BET!

I feel odd about doing my whole tags at the end of the description shtick with this particular video, so I'll change it up. By far, my favorite part of this video was doing the cute little farm animal animations. I was so elated with each and every one. I look at this stuff and go, ""haha. Chicken!"" I look at what I've done and say, ""Aww, now they're hugging"". You know what? You're a good listener, I think I'm comfortable using tags around you. So yeah this video is about Ai generated anime, mother's basement made this video that got the gears in my head turning. That's about all.

#jessicakirson 










Jessica Kirson is a powerhouse on stage. She‚Äôs a hilariously relatable performer of sheer silliness, vulnerability, and ridiculous characters. Her countless comedic character videos have racked up over 50 million views on social media. Her audience is multigenerational, creating an excuse for large groups of friends and families to spend a night out together. In an era where only 10% of all touring comedians are female, Jessica stands out as one of the strongest comedians regardless of gender.

Jessica produced FX‚Äôs Hysterical, a feature-length documentary that premiered at SXSW 2021. The film explores the changing landscape of women in stand-up comedy and features Margaret Cho, Nikki Glazer, Chelsea Handler, Fortune Feimster, and other notable comedians. Her one-hour special Talking to Myself was executive produced by Bill Burr and debuted on Comedy Central. She is a regular on This Week at the Comedy Cellar and has appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The View, HBO‚Äôs, Crashing, and Kevin Can Wait. She also recently acted in and served as a consultant, producer, and writer on the Robert De Niro film The Comedian.

Jessica‚Äôs highly anticipated prank call album, The Call Girls, also featuring Rachel Feinstein, was released on September 24th. Recorded virtually during the depths of quarantine, the album features characters such as old Jewish grandmothers, sexy co-eds, a conservative mother and her gay son, and more.

Jessica‚Äôs characters are coming to life in her new podcast, Disgusting Hawk with rave reviews. Through her Relatively Sane podcast, Jessica has interviewed the likes of Bill Burr, Jim Gaffigan, and Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell.

She was awarded ‚ÄúBest Female Comic‚Äù by the MAC association in New York City and received the prestigious Nightlife Award for ‚ÄúBest Stand-up Comedian.‚Äù In her spare time, Jessica is a regular contributor to The Howard Stern Show, where she produces and stars in prank calls for the program.

Don't Make This 808 Tuning Mistake! ‚ùå,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm-_EpEuqMg,Cableguys,Music,"['how to tune 808', 'how to get 808 in key', '808 tuning', 'pitching 808', '808 key', '808 transpose', 'tuning 808s', '808 in key', 'how to tune 808 fl', 'how to tune 808 ableton', '808 out of key', '808 tips', 'why do my 808s sound bad', 'how to tune 808s', 'how to mix 808']",2023-11-02T13:31:14.914Z,"Try or buy Cableguys plugins: https://www.cableguys.com/products.html

A tip I see a lot when tuning 808 samples is to pitch the 808 up by 1, 2 or 3 octaves, so you can easily hear the pitch.

But here‚Äôs the problem with this. Most 808 samples have a pitchbend, where the pitch starts high, and drops down to a lower pitch.

When pitched 2 octaves up, an 808 sample will play back at four times the speed, shortening the attack.

Now the attack goes by so fast, you end up focusing on the long decay/sustain of the 808, and tuning to that.

Then when you pitch back down to the bass range, the attack is out of key.

If it's a busy pattern, you might be retriggering the 808 so much that the tail is hardly heard, depending on the sample and the style of music.

So your 808 will sound out of tune!

Stay tuned for my next video, where I‚Äôll show you a trick to tune your 808s perfectly without pitching up."

One year ago we decided to sell most of our stuff, give up our lease in Los Angeles and live a more flexible lifestyle. We weren‚Äôt planning to be nomads in the traditional sense.

But we did want to split our time between Sydney and Philadelphia to be closer to our families, and we knew renting a long-term apartment probably wasn‚Äôt realistic. So we decided to just take the leap and see where it took us. And that‚Äôs brought us here.

Hi there üëã If you're new here my name is Matt D'Avella. I'm a documentary filmmaker, entrepreneur and YouTuber. I've made a couple documentaries for Netflix. I also teach courses on everything from filmmaking to habit change. If you like to nerd out about self-development as much as I do, you can subscribe for weekly videos.

Variations on the Twelve-Bar Blues: Bird Blues,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4F278t62qc,Walk That Bass,Education,"['Twelve-bar Blues', 'Blues (Musical Genre)', 'Bird Changes', 'Jazz Blues', 'Blues Piano Tutorial']",2023-11-01T21:52:04.302Z,"If you like this lesson, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/c/WalkThatBass

And if you want to learn Jazz Piano, please do check out my website: https://www.thejazzpianosite.com/

In this series of videos I cover a number of variations on the twelve bar blues. Over the years, various musicians have modified the 12 bar blues in order to make it a little more interesting and unique. So I plan to cover a whole bunch of different variations or modifications or changes that are often used over the 12 bar blues. Some are quite simple and only involve one or two chord changes, but others are more complex and jazzy

In this lesson I cover the Bird Blues. This is as far away from Blues as you can get with a 12 bar blues. It's got a heap of chord substitutions and circle of fifth runs. It's far more jazz than it is blues, but still good fun to play.

Standard 12 bar blues:
I    |  I  | I | I |
IV | IV | I | I |
V  | IV | I | I |

Standard 12 bar blues:
C7 | C7 | C7 | C7 |

In this video, I traveled across the world to one of the biggest hotspots for digital nomads in Bali, Indonesia. I got to ask strangers a bunch of questions about what they do for a living, how much money they make, advice for others, and a bunch of other spicy questions about the lifestyle costs in Bali, business, and philosophy.

I've always wondered what types of people are working online in Bali, so make sure you watch the entire video because I was able to find a lot of really cool people with very interesting income streams and businesses! 

I hope this video inspires you if you're looking to become a digital nomad and make money online! My goal is to motivate you guys with success stories from other people that are crushing it, so that you can learn from their experiences and replicate their success. There is so much opportunity out there and money is flowing all around us, and I think this video proves that there are so many creative ways you can make money online nowadays.

I think being a ""passport bro"" and having complete location and time freedom is the best lifestyle possible - and I was truly inspired getting to visit Bali. We filmed this video in late July 2023, during my 3 week trip to Australia, Bali, Jakarta, Singapore, and Tokyo! We stayed for about a week in an epic Villa in Bali: Villa Atas Ombak in Seminyak!

The entire line of the Surface computer was notorious for being nearly impossible to repair, with most repair shops outright refusing them due to the minefield of problems even the simplest jobs would cause. Thankfully the Microsoft Surface design team listened to its users and as of 2019 repair became a main focus on all of their devices. They even began selling parts directly to consumers on their website, something that's still very rare in the tech world. The Surface team deserves credit for this, and I hope this video let's their team know their efforts are appreciated by both consumers and repair shops alike! The more repairable we make technology, the less e-waste is dumped into landfills."

One individual asks if an iPad is a good choice for college, to which another individual responds with a shocking statement that getting an iPad for college is a terrible decision.

The individual who supports the use of an iPad explains that it is a great tool for making notes with the Apple pencil and apps like GoodNotes. However, they also argue that an iPad is not all it seems to be, especially when it comes to the most effective way to remember things in school, which is active recall.

After a brief exchange, the individual explains that active recall can be done easily on a computer and faster with typing. This video provides valuable insights into the use of an iPad for college and highlights the limitations of using it for academic purposes.

If you're a student considering getting an iPad for college, this video is a must-watch. Don't forget to like and follow for more informative content like this.

More about Gianmarco:
Gianmarco Soresi is a stand-up comedian, actor, and a little too much for some people. He‚Äôs told jokes on The Late Late Show with James Corden, Comedy Central, Netflix‚Äôs Bonding, Don‚Äôt Tell, The Real Housewives of New York for some reason, and he was a JFL New Face in 2022. He‚Äôs acted in Billy Crystal‚Äôs Here Today, Hustlers, The Last OG, and in his theater days shared the stage with some people who‚Äôve gone on to become huge real estate agents. You can see him post the kind of crowdwork clips that are arguably destroying the artform of stand-up comedy everywhere @gianmarcosoresi and he obviously has a podcast called The Downside with Gianmarco Soresi.üé§

LYRICS

That‚Äôs my n*gga I see that he envy
Too much money come out the ceiling
Spike dee come around here he the villain
I was posted up smoking, I'm chillin
N*ggas really be set on them millions
If I'm wrong I can never play victim
Middle finger, I shoot to the system
Rest in peace to my brother, I miss him
If I see you I might kill the issue
Pull up on you, the engine a missile

I don't really think they like me
I don't really think they like me
I don't really think they like me
Wanna put blood on my white tee
I don't really think they like me
I don't really think they like me
I don't really think they like me
(Think they like me)

Gotta get it I‚Äôm straight to the cake doe
Ask my brother he got a new case load
SE and I don‚Äôt have a case for it
Text me ima hit ya like skateboard
Sideline lil shawty she choosey
Lemme really take you to the movies


Shawty wanna yah shop, that‚Äôs some Nike‚Äôs
Pull up in a rag top that‚Äôs the 90s
Shawty got the jag drop
That‚Äôs so like me
Me and her forever though
That‚Äôs so likely x2

Baby got the cash flow so I like it
She gone ride the bike 2 like a cyclist
You can read my mind girl like a psychic
Swimming in yo whole world like a Pisces
You done change my mindset, now I try things
Baby girl the whole set, that‚Äôs my whole thing"

Brought to you by Raycon.

This Risk of Rain documentary details the development of indie 2D pixel art action platformer Risk of Rain and 3D roguelike shooter Risk of Rain 2 and goes behind the scenes of their creation. Discover more about developer Hopoo Games and its two founders, Duncan Drummond and Paul Morse. Risk of Rain‚Äôs development journey goes all the way back to 2012, when Duncan and Paul embarked on a university project focused on programming. In the game's initial prototype, players defended their crashed ship from an onslaught of monsters, and straying further from the ship would increase the difficulty. This concept eventually transformed into the ‚Äútime = difficulty‚Äù system and gave Risk of Rain its own identity. The documentary also explores all the design decisions that Hopoo Games made and shows how much the team experimented with the game‚Äôs difficulty, especially when it comes to how enemies scale in power. Additionally, they had to come up with a clever solution when the enemy spawn AI started spawning way too many monsters on the battlefield and caused performance issues.

It also takes a close look at all the hurdles the team had to go through. Going from a 2D pixel art action platformer to a 3D roguelike shooter presented many challenges, mainly because neither Duncan or Paul had any experience creating 3D models, let alone other technical nuances that came with designing a 3D game. They soon discovered that they couldn't directly adapt any of the original gameplay elements into the sequel. Therefore, every class and monster taken from the original had to undergo substantial revisions. Furthermore, the documentary also provided insight into the deal made between Hopoo Games and Gearbox and why Duncan and Paul sold the rights to the Risk of Rain IP. Lastly, Duncan and Paul share their thoughts on the recently announced remake Risk of Rain Returns and what‚Äôs next for them and their game development studio.

"Why Isometric? | Art, Code and Matrix Maths | A Devlog",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fZXlxtMbC0,Wintermute Digital,Film & Animation,"['art', 'indie game', 'gamedev', 'development', 'code', 'math']",2023-10-31T02:53:22.332Z,"This indie game development log (devlog) explains the high level concept, a method to make near perfect pixel art isometric tiles, the linear algebra of transformation matrices and the code changes and considerations you need when converting a game to an isometric format. 

There's just something special about isometric games. They capture the retro feel of using 2D graphics to display a 3D world, in a time where immense, billion polygon 3D landscapes are now industry standard. 

Join me for a dive into pixel ratios, matrix multiplications, and theoretically perfect but realistically rather buggy code.

--- Note --- Feedback on programming is appreciated! If you don't know how to code, that's alright, my explanation of the maths is much more technical. Linear algebra is quite cool! Do not take coding advice from me, I am definitely not an expert :) ---

A text version of this will be up on my website in a day or two, with other tutorials, game devlogs and interesting blog posts, at wintermutedigital.com.

Animal Crossing: Wild World / City Folk - 3am / 03:00 (1 Hour Extended),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uiyki6MOXTE,comfymomcozydad,Music,[''],2023-10-31T01:37:20.091Z,"Game: Animal Crossing Wild World / City Folk / Let's Go to the City
Music: 3am / 03:00
Composer: Kazumi Totaka
Platform: Nintendo DS/Wii

The Wii version of the game stores it's soundtrack audio data as a proprietary Sound Archive format which contains the samples and sequence data in it's own, again, proprietary sound format (some deviation of ADPCM along with it's own SEQ format, not MIDI)

All the previously exisiting rips sound like they were ran through a blender and are practically unlistenable so I did some digging and found that someone had mostly figured this all out on some obscure forum and kindly dumped all the games music as WAV's. Great.

This still isn't perfect but it's ""good enough"" and you probably won't notice the difference. The only thing missing are the audio effects as it seems the paramaters for things like reverb and delay haven't been extracted from the game, or at least a new dump with the paramters hasn't been made.

5 of these ""Hour"" songs are available on 2 Japanese-only CD's that sound like utter dogshit. It's like listening to what you think all these old rips should sound like but on a properly pressed CD. You can tell the CD mixes have panning that's different to these extracted tracks as well, but, I prefer it this way and i'm the dumbass that's uploading these all for about 5 people to enjoy so shut up."

*Since there are a lot who ask for tabs in the comments and want to learn this song cover unfortunately I don't know how to make tabs... I just listened to the song but I'll gladly share you the chords:

C#maj7, C7, Fm7, G#, A#m

And in the last part there's a change key using same chords but half step backwards:

Cmaj7, B7, Em7, G, Am

Everything just revolves around these chords mostly barre chords... 
Just watch how I play the cover and decrease the playback speed cause the song tempo is actually fast... Good Luck!üòâ"

In this video, my MOM reacts to Porter Robinson's 2021 album nurture. This album has songs such as Look at the Sky, Get Your Wish, Something Comforting, Musician, Mirror, and many other tracks. One of the best electronic albums according to Fader and to Anthony Fantano, who reviewed the album and gave it an 8! Maybe soon she will react to Porter's album Worlds, which has hits such as Sad Machine, Goodbye to a World, Sea of Voices, Divinity, and many more!
