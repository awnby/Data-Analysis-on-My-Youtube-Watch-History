Japanese vs American Sports,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qb-4-7IzU8,magnify,Entertainment,"['fun facts', 'sports', 'history time', 'cultures', 'languages', 'japan', 'sumo', '相撲', 'NBA', 'antropology']",2023-12-15T05:01:42.047Z,"Sports often serve as a mirror, reflecting the underlying values and cultural ethos of a society. 

Sumo wrestling, a sport deeply rooted in Japanese tradition, is more than just a competitive endeavor; it is a cultural ceremony. The sport's reverence for ritual, its adherence to a strict code of conduct, and the lifetime status of the Yokozuna – the highest-ranking wrestler who retains the title even after defeat – all reflect key Japanese values. This includes a deep respect for tradition, honor, and the concept of 'ichigo ichie', which emphasizes the importance of each moment and encounter. The brief, intense nature of sumo bouts, often lasting mere seconds, underscores the value placed on precision and the decisive moment, a reflection of a culture that venerates mastery and the perfection of craft.

In contrast, basketball in the United States epitomizes American values of individualism, showmanship, and meritocracy. The sport celebrates not only team achievements but also individual prowess and star power. 

 Through sports, cultures express their identity, values, and aspirations."

Are we supposed to watch games? Or play them? The question I've been having to ask myself way more lately with mostly AAA gaming. It feels like a visual spectacle with now gameplay. Graphics and overall horsepower, trumping the gameplay. Aren't games supposed to be fun? Seems like most big budget studios have been playing it very safe with marketing and gameplay.

The Reason Styles Are Always Changing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAGqH_yK2SE,magnify,Entertainment,"['fun facts', 'history time', 'style', 'fashion trends', 'furniture design', 'apparel', 'aesthetics', 'philosophy']",2023-12-13T14:31:54.031Z,"The hairstyles of 2020 look nothing like what was popular in 2010.  Why do styles change? 

Art historian Wilhelm Worringer suggested that the styles we find appealing are often a response to something we feel is lacking in society.

For instance, after World War II, a world that had experienced so much chaos and destruction craved stability and reliability. This longing was reflected in the rise of mid-century modern furniture, known for its clean lines and simplistic design. It provided a sense of order and calmness in a world that was recovering from turmoil.

The 1980s were characterized by bold, extravagant hairstyles, perhaps as a way to express freedom and individuality during a time of economic growth and relative peace. In contrast, today's hairstyles might be simpler or more natural, possibly reflecting a societal desire for authenticity and environmental consciousness in an increasingly digital and artificial world.

It's easy to dismiss styles that we don't personally find attractive, but rather than making fun of people for having different taste than our own, author Alain de Botton suggests we should ask ourselves 'What thing would a person have to lack in order to see a certain style as beautiful?"" and in doing so we can come to know the ""tenor of their deprivation."""

The improvement was to my code from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-AfhLQfb6w

This is episode 038 of the A Problem Squared podcast which started it all: https://aproblemsquared.libsyn.com/038-fldxt-in-wordle-and-improv-tact-hurdle

Here is Benjamin Paaßen's full grid of all results and techniques used. It also has links to all the code as well. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11sUBkPSEhbGx2K8ah6WbGV62P8ii5l5vVeMpkzk17PI/edit#gid=0

The article by ""encody"" I mentioned: https://medium.com/geeklaunch/how-to-speed-up-your-code-224-444-739-using-graphs-cc37dc395c0c

This is the reverse-frequency alphabet. Which is frequency in words, not in use (which would allow for frequency of word use; this list counts each word once).

And whynot, a whole bunch of code. All of it is better than mine. All of it. (Even if you ran it all sequentially.)

CORRECTIONS
- Ha, I got the percentage around the wrong way. Should be 40,832,277,770% better.
- Yes, I missed the binary digit for the ""A"" in ""BREAD"" and everyone in the live premier chat noticed. Sorry about that. 🍞
- Let me know if you spot any other mistakes!

Their talent is so grossly underrated i think it’s just a matter of time before they get the recognition they deserve.  If you have a chance to see them this time around, do it.  This may be the last time we get to see them up close and intimate.  I have a feeling the next time they come through they’ll be playing hockey arenas."

Vince Staples - Big Fish (Reaction/Review) #Meamda,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yqEHUYV4a4,Meami,Entertainment,[''],2023-12-12T22:37:07.261Z,"What an album from the boy Vince Staples . A definite 180 from his previous work in where he takes a techno rap approach while still intertwining his west coast vibes. Tracks like "" Big Fish"" and ""Rain Come Down"" gives you watery electronic sounds while still keeping Vince's uptempo style. The album is well put together and something very different from what we're accustomed to in the rap scene. A must listen for 2017!

Why Vince Staples Sabotaged His Career (On Purpose),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvWyOSyDyGI,Louaista,Music,"['hip hop', 'canvas', 'canvas man', 'louaista']",2023-12-12T21:51:02.515Z,"Vince Staples was once a rapper who had everything needed to become a mainstream success. His album ""Summertime 06"" went #2 on Billboard. His songs ""Norf Norf,"" ""Nate,"" ""Senorita"" and many more achieved over 50+ million views on YouTube. He was very funny and likeable - being that he had always seemed wise beyond his years and never flaunted his money and fame. He's never done dr*gs or has ever tasted alcohol. However, upon getting famous and signing a multimillion dollar deal - Vince willingly chose to step away from the spotlight. This was in part due to the content he was displaying in his lyrics - where he portrayed the image of the gangster lifestyle in which he grew up on. Doing so made him realize he was motivating people to commit violent crimes that would lead to more death and crimes that he was accustomed to seeing growing up. And he didn't wanna contribute to that anymore.

This is the SHOCKING story of Vince Staples.

The story goes that when Nas heard J.Cole’s radio single, “Work Out,” he was apparently disappointed in Cole for abandoning lyricism. Now, No I.D. was in the same room when Nas expressed his discontent, and later I.D told Cole over the phone about Nas' opinion of his song. Cole, having stated his extreme love for Nas on multiple occasions, took this to heart, and released Let Nas Down. Nas later responded with a remix of Let Nas Down, Made Nas Proud"

In this video we talk a bit more about data structures and optimizations, specifically we'll get into linked lists vs arrays, how to do common operations on them, and what happens to the underlying memory. These all have impacts on how they perform, it's not solely about big-O, cache locality effects come into play and we can understand in what situations an array or a linked list is expected to perform better. We'll work through some real world examples to bring the point home and get a solid understanding of these data structures.

What's covered:
* What are linked lists
* The importance of contiguous memory, and CPU caches
* Linked list vs arrays, what each operation does and roughly which one is faster
* Memory implications vs arrays
* Closing thoughts, and when I've personally found linked lists useful in my career"

The Problem with the 'Yay Science!' Crowd,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVPy25wQ07k,Medlife Crisis,Education,"['Medlife Crisis', 'Medicine', 'Science', 'Education', 'Comedy', 'Doctor', 'Cardiology', 'Medical School', 'Biology']",2023-12-12T14:02:08.174Z,"What is 'soft scientism'?

What is 'soft scientism'? Well, you probably won't know, because I just made the term up. I have a lot of thoughts about scientism and science communication. These are just a few of them, with a particular focus on 2020 and the pandemic.

Watching this back, I am wondering if I need to stop making videos at 3am because I'm not sure I got my point across at all. I'm just a bit fed up of people giving the impression that science is a magical entity that knows all the answers. Of course all of this pre-dates COVID, we're awash with YouTube channels, blogs and social media accounts which fetishise science in harmful ways. People praise crackpots that ""cite sources"", which is a meaningless term. Cherry-picking data that supports your argument isn't ""citing source"" accurately. A quack talking about cosmic energy is easy to spot. A qualified doctor talking about vitamin D, autophagy, telomeres, cryonics, magnesium, ions, keto etc etc *might* be just as big a quack as the first guy but will appear totally legit to most people (NB - all those areas have interesting avenues of investigation, but are prone to attracting people who are unable to appraise quality of data).

This is it folks - Devlog 0.
I’m a Solo Indie Game Developer making a 2D Platformer inspired by Ghostrunner and Celeste. Join me on my game dev journey as I go in-depth on all the game design lessons I learn while I undertake this undertaking.

In this episode, I talk about how game mechanics, level design and meta progression work in tandem to produce a gameplay loop that keeps players coming back. 
I pull from a tonne of different sources, including Game Maker’s Toolkit, GDC and even some academics like Bartle and Juul. 

The next episode will most likely be about how I’m creating and implementing the game’s adaptive music, so stay tuned and what not.

See you down in the comments.

authority figures seem to get away with murder all time. but how do those killings become acceptable? The philosopher Giorgio Agamben thinks about these issues with his concept of homo sacer: someone who can be killed without it being murder or sacrifice. when sovereign power is always an exception to the law, they get to create homo sacer. 

as i say at the end of the video, homo sacer is not a perfect theory. agamben is far from the only philosopher to think about biopolitics. i'd love to hear your thoughts about what he gets right and what he gets wrong. you might also think his theory is the most politically useful, even if it's not the most accurate, historically or logically speaking.

Kobe Bryant was right about James Harden and his style of play, Harden 1 v1 which now makes things worse playing alongside 3 other Hall Of Famers in Russell Westbrook, Kawhi Leonard, and Paul George.  Only time will tell if it all works out for this LA Clippers trade.  So far, Kobe Bryant was right about James Harden.

Lebron Disrespectfully EXPOSES Zion's Limitations,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty7A9pTTEp4,Heat Check,Sports,"['lakers highlights', 'lakers pacers', 'lakers in season tournament', 'los angeles lakers', 'lakers vs pacers', 'in season tournament', 'nba tournament', 'nba finals lakers', 'lebron james vs indiana', 'lebron vs indiana', 'lebron james mvp', 'lebron mvp', 'anthony davis vs indiana', 'anthony davis', 'lebron', 'lebron james', 'lebron james highlights', 'lebron highlights', 'heat check', 'bballbreakdown', 'am hoops', 'jxmy', 'jxmyhighroller', 'espn', 'thinking basketball']",2023-12-09T15:04:58.701Z,"Support by buying my NBA T-Shirts:  https://heatcheck.info/

This is how Lebron disrespectfully exposed Zion’s limitations. Look at him parked all the way under the basket waiting for Williamson and baiting him to shoot any kind of shot.
Just look at this, Zion has the ball but he doesn’t know what to do with it. Valanciunas comes over to set a screen but they’re all too deep and now it’s just crowded. Eventually you got this awkward barreling right into Lebron and this is an offensive foul.
Seriously, look at him going left and right without any idea of what to do. The terrible spacing here doesn’t help him either, so he just has to flip it back to Ingram who forces up a contested jumper. Awful possession.
The game plan was simple. James goes under on all screens and waits for him at the rim, while Davis meets him right here just to not allow Zion to get a head of steam. 
And all of these blunders where he runs over people for the offensive foul is based on the fact that he doesn’t have a back to the basket game, no baby jumper, no hooks or a fadeaway shot.
His main and only weapon in the half court is to get a head of steam, take off and adjust midair for the layup or the dunk.
And you can see that it was the exact same scenario in the second half as well, only this time he knows a charge is coming so he tries to avoid it and thus misses the layup. 
Williamson was also a complete no show on defense. This type of jogging back while his guy is wide open, and knocks down a three pointer is inexcusable.
Check out this freeze frame of all 5 of his teammates pointing where he should be, and where he actually is-all the way on the other side, and of course Prince hits this one from downtown.
And then right here, he just watches D’Angello Russell go by him all the way to the rim for the layup without any kind of effort to stop him.
The inside the NBA crew criticized him heavily first of all for the shape he’s in, but then also for his overall mentality and lack of aggression.
And how can you not criticize him, when he only shot 8 times for 13 points. 8 shots from your franchise cornerstone in an elimination game like this is unacceptable.
So now compare all of this, along with his postgame comments saying that he’s gotta be more aggressive and look- compare that to the intensity of almost a 39 year old Lebron. 
Not only did he come ready to fight from the very first possession, he kept the intensity throughout the entire time, and not just on offense, but look at him doing the little things grabbing Zion on the boxout not allowing him to even see the basketball.
Check out the energy here on this rebound and tell me did this game mean to him or not.
And this is possibly the best example. Watch where Lebron is and where Zion is, and notice the contrast of one guy going full speed and the other acting like this is a scrimmage.
And when you display this kind of passion throughout the entire game, then the basketball gods award you and here come the heat checks.
Lebron and the Lakers deserve to be in the finals as they expose another western contender. They did the same thing to Phoenix the last game and I explained exactly what they did. Check it out here. Talk to you in the next one. Peace out."

Lyrics:
I told myself, I was never gonna make it
2 years later, Me and Louie damn near we made it
Shout out the team, We got those are some Good Buddies
Shout out to, The b*tch I want know damn well
She don't want me, She got a n*gga few years later…
Duh! Life happens!
I don't even, Wanna talk n*ggas don't like rappin’
N*ggas wanna hear me, Yell on a track and–

Baby, I’m in outer space
You know this, I’ve been here before 
Baby, I’ve been here before 
Baby, why you gotta call?

Hold up, Damn! 
Drippin’ dressin’ out the water 
Huh, Okay!
 I got this b*tch, I don't wan’ call her
Huh, Okay! 
Yes I have, Been ashamed yes I have got my d*ck
Sucked by people, I do not wanna name
No that's not, What I said you misread me
Please read that, Again I got text from way back 
Back when, You said you were gonna do it 
For a sec–

I’m bricked up 
Why the fuck you stalling?
Appalling
Everything I'm dreaming 
I’m balling 
Blue faces like Meseeks
Nicotine im fiending 
Cancerous the incense 
I don’t believe in sense
Keep your two away from me 
She like nutt no mabaline
What’s in the cup?
It maybe lean
I’m spiralling 
Talking shit I'm firing 
Im boss now
Had to pay the price now 

Baby, I’m in outer space
You know this, I’ve been here before 
Baby, I’ve been here before 
Baby, why you gotta call?

He don't talk sh*t, He still wanna...He take shots
But he don't, Got a glock I’m still wasting time
On the clock, I don't f**k around wit n*ggas at all!
I don't f**k ‘round, Wit b*tches at all! Hmm! Hmm!
I don't f**k ‘round, Wit bitches at all!
I don't f**k around, Wit n*ggas at all!

This time around I am going to attempt to once again hijack a pre-rigged CC4 Avatar (Kevin) and transform him into a functional looking Shadow the Hedgehog.  Just like with Bunnie Rabbot this will be my first attempt at morphing the CC4 Kevin model into something this non human like.  If you dont wanna see these steps feel free to unfollow for a while but we got quite a few days of ugly to get through before it starts looking anything like the intended character.  

Todays session taking Kevadow (lol) into Zbrush for more fine tuned refinements on trying to morph the human pre-rigged face to match up to the cartoony head of the hedgehog reference model.  Is the most difficult and and can make or break the result depending on how well you alight up the shapes.  If the process starts to take too long I may back track and try my luck with Zwrap instead but the smoothness of the reference sonic model and some of its forms are not idea compared to whats see on the mood board from Sonic Movie 2.

Again shout out to Frictory 213 on sketchfab for a solid ref to work based off of. 

This ref model can be found here for those interested.
https://sketchfab.com/nicolascorrea0907

If you are a CC4 user you may wanna follow this whole process just to keep up with some success stories, missteps and backtracks.  There will be plenty of mistakes made I assure you but the point is taking advantage of these pre-rigged humanoids, putting your own new bones and appendages on them and still retaining CC4s built in facial rigging if you are like me, a character modeler/texturer with no animation chops whatsoever. Come along for the journey, this mess is finna be wild!"

Apple is set to revolutionize the laptop scene with the introduction of its latest MacBook Pro powered by the M3 chip, which is expected to be based on TSMC's latest 3nm process technology. This advancement aims at enhancing both performance and power efficiency significantly. The M3 chip maintains an 8-core CPU configuration similar to the M2, yet it's anticipated to provide substantial improvements upon its release​1​.

The M3 series includes the base M3 chip, and extends to the more powerful M3 Pro and M3 Max chips. They represent the pinnacle of personal computing chips, being the industry’s first 3-nanometer chipsets. They introduce a next-generation GPU architecture, promising dramatic performance enhancements, a faster CPU and Neural Engine, and an increase in unified memory support​2​.

Specifically, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip is touted not just for handling everyday tasks with ease but also for delivering outstanding sustained performance for professional applications and gaming. This makes it an ideal tool for creative professionals, students, and entrepreneurs alike​3​.

In terms of technical specifications, the M3 chip comprises an 8-core CPU with four performance and four efficiency cores, alongside a 10-core GPU. It features hardware-accelerated ray tracing, a 16-core Neural Engine, and a 100GB/s memory bandwidth. The media engine supports hardware-accelerated H.264, HEVC, ProRes, and ProRes RAW video encode and decode engines​4​.

For those requiring even more robust performance, the M3 Pro chip builds upon the M3's capabilities by providing additional unified memory for more demanding applications, capable of handling gigapixel panoramas, compiling vast amounts of code, and editing multiple streams of 8K video. It can be configured with up to 36GB of unified memory and supports up to two external displays​​.

Moreover, these new models boast the longest battery life ever seen in a Mac. Specifically, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip can last up to 22 hours when watching movies, making it a powerhouse for both work and entertainment​​.

Performance-wise, the M3 silicon upgrade is expected to deliver speeds that are 50% faster than the M1 models and offer an 11x speed boost over the fastest Intel-based MacBook Pros previously available​7.

On this episode of The Danny Brown Show, Zelooperz of Bruiser Brigade pops by to talk about funny rappers, GOAT rappers, and naked TV shows. The two also discuss barbie car racing, King Cobra’s moonshine, and whether or not ghosts are real. Danny recommends to a listener that they wait out a break up for a Steam Deck and Zelooperz seems to really enjoy a freestyle. Also, we had a snake in the studio! It’s always a fun time when Danny has a friend on the show. Enjoy!

Topics covered include: Frame debugging, voxels, mesh voxelization, flood fill propagation, ray marching, volumetric transmittance, volumetric shadows, worley noise, phase functions, and signed distance functions.

Everything is a rental - you own nothing, and pay heavily for it. Before there were digital services that took automatic payments from your bank account, there was a library. 

The library (contrary to my previous belief) is not stuck in the stone ages, and has evolved with time. Pretty much any mainstream digital streaming service that you can think, the library has a solution for. 

In this video we talk about Kanopy, a free movie streaming service that has likely the best catalogue of highly rated films online. And it's free... with your library card. 

Libby & Overdrive are two audiobook services that replaces the need for audible. 

Pressreader is a free version of Apple News. 

These options are all there, and accessible to you.

The Greeks, like many ancient civilizations, recognized the need for a portable and reusable surface for writing and record-keeping, and wax tablets provided a solution.

The origin of wax tablets can be traced back to ancient Mesopotamia, where clay tablets were used for writing. The Greeks, influenced by the advanced civilizations of the East, adopted this practice but modified it to suit their needs. Instead of using clay, they employed wooden boards covered in wax.

One of the key advantages of wax tablets was their reusability. Writing on the wax surface could be easily erased using a stylus or a heated instrument, allowing for the tablets to be used again and again. This made them an efficient tool for education, as students could learn by repeatedly practicing on the same tablet.

Additionally, wax tablets were portable and lightweight, making them convenient for travelers, merchants, and scholars. They were also less fragile than clay tablets, which made them suitable for frequent handling and transport."

During the ceremony, new engineers recite a pledge that was surprisingly written by author Rudyard Kipling.  During the ceremony, the graduates are presented with an iron ring to be worn on the little finger of their working hand to remind them of their ethical obligations. 

I think the concept of professional oaths would be really interesting for other fields, like social media content creators, if anyone wants to take a stab at what exactly that oath should entail.... @hankschannel"

The Craft of Quill Pens,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pFGyxxY260,magnify,Entertainment,"['history time', 'writing', 'calligraphy', 'fun facts', 'languages']",2023-12-06T02:30:31.282Z,"When the reed pen died out, the quill pen was invented around the 6th century in Seville, Spain.

Writing with a quill pen is a fascinating art that requires more than just plucking a feather and dipping it in ink. The process is intricate and demands careful attention to detail. First and foremost, selecting the appropriate feather is crucial. Different birds yield feathers with varying qualities, such as flexibility and durability. For instance, swan feathers are often preferred due to their strong and flexible nature.

Preparing the feather for writing is a meticulous task. The feather needs to be cleaned, trimmed, and boiled to remove any residual oils and make it more pliable. After boiling, it is dried in hot sand to maintain its shape and prevent it from curling or splitting during use.

One of the most intricate steps involves carving the nib, which determines the thickness and flow of the ink. The nib's tip needs to be delicately shaped and slit to ensure smooth ink flow and precise strokes. It demands skilled craftsmanship and practice to master this art.

In conclusion, writing with a quill pen involves a comprehensive process beyond the initial perception. From selecting the right feather to meticulously preparing it and carving the nib, this ancient practice demands a deep understanding of materials and craftsmanship. It is a testament to the patience and skill required to produce beautiful, intricate script with such a traditional writing instrument."

Apple is set to revolutionize the laptop scene with the introduction of its latest MacBook Pro powered by the M3 chip, which is expected to be based on TSMC's latest 3nm process technology. This advancement aims at enhancing both performance and power efficiency significantly. The M3 chip maintains an 8-core CPU configuration similar to the M2, yet it's anticipated to provide substantial improvements upon its release​1​.

The M3 series includes the base M3 chip, and extends to the more powerful M3 Pro and M3 Max chips. They represent the pinnacle of personal computing chips, being the industry’s first 3-nanometer chipsets. They introduce a next-generation GPU architecture, promising dramatic performance enhancements, a faster CPU and Neural Engine, and an increase in unified memory support​2​.

Specifically, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip is touted not just for handling everyday tasks with ease but also for delivering outstanding sustained performance for professional applications and gaming. This makes it an ideal tool for creative professionals, students, and entrepreneurs alike​3​.

In terms of technical specifications, the M3 chip comprises an 8-core CPU with four performance and four efficiency cores, alongside a 10-core GPU. It features hardware-accelerated ray tracing, a 16-core Neural Engine, and a 100GB/s memory bandwidth. The media engine supports hardware-accelerated H.264, HEVC, ProRes, and ProRes RAW video encode and decode engines​4​.

For those requiring even more robust performance, the M3 Pro chip builds upon the M3's capabilities by providing additional unified memory for more demanding applications, capable of handling gigapixel panoramas, compiling vast amounts of code, and editing multiple streams of 8K video. It can be configured with up to 36GB of unified memory and supports up to two external displays​​.

Moreover, these new models boast the longest battery life ever seen in a Mac. Specifically, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip can last up to 22 hours when watching movies, making it a powerhouse for both work and entertainment​​.

Performance-wise, the M3 silicon upgrade is expected to deliver speeds that are 50% faster than the M1 models and offer an 11x speed boost over the fastest Intel-based MacBook Pros previously available​7.

The great debate: Doors vs Wheels.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNKUZlyDK6Q,magnify,Entertainment,"['languages', 'linguistics', 'fun facts', 'english', 'mindblown']",2023-12-06T02:15:24.682Z,"""Doors vs Wheels"" a popular internet question that poses a hypothetical scenario and asks whether there are more doors in the world or more wheels. The question is intended to spark discussion and debate, as there are various factors to consider when attempting to answer it.

Those who argue for ""doors"" might point out that doors are present in every building, including homes, offices, schools, and public places. They are essential for privacy, security, and accessibility. Doors also come in various types, such as hinged doors, sliding doors, revolving doors, and garage doors, further increasing their overall count.

On the other hand, supporters of ""wheels"" contend that wheels are widespread and found in a wide range of objects. From vehicles like cars, bicycles, and motorcycles to industrial machinery, carts, chairs, and even small gadgets, wheels are an integral part of our daily lives. Additionally, wheels can come in different sizes, ranging from tiny rollers to large industrial wheels, adding to their overall abundance.

Ultimately, the debate doesn't have a definitive answer as it depends on the interpretation of the question and the parameters considered. The purpose of such debates is often to engage in thought-provoking discussions rather than to arrive at a conclusive answer."

It's up to the cast to scrutinize, strategize, and vote out the non-hoopers. Join us as our contestants delve into discussions, observe, and analyze every move to identify the three individuals who are not versed in the ways of the basketball court. The tension rises as alliances form, suspicions mount, and the fate of the non-hoopers hangs in the balance.

The Strangeness of Pronouns,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K5lKGgq5-4,magnify,Entertainment,"['languages', 'sociology', 'fun facts', 'english', 'german', 'spanish', 'french']",2023-12-03T17:20:42.307Z,"The unique characteristics of English pronoun usage, including the capitalization of ""I"" and the absence of formal and familiar pronoun tenses, can be seen as reflections of English culture and societal values.

The capitalization of ""I"" in English signifies a sense of individualism and self-importance that has been deeply ingrained in Western culture. It highlights the emphasis on personal identity and autonomy, which can be traced back to philosophical and cultural developments in English-speaking societies. The capitalization serves as a visual reminder of the significance placed on the self and individual agency.

Similarly, the absence of a formal and familiar pronoun tense in English reflects a cultural inclination towards egalitarianism and informality. English-speaking societies tend to value equality and the notion that all individuals should be treated with the same level of respect and familiarity. By not distinguishing between formal and familiar pronoun forms, English promotes a more egalitarian communication style, where social hierarchies are downplayed.

In contrast to English, other cultures with distinct values exhibit different pronoun usage, offering insights into their unique cultural perspectives. For instance, in some languages, the collective nature of society is reflected in the inclusive pronouns used. These pronouns encompass not only the speaker and listener but also include family members and other close individuals. This inclusive approach emphasizes communal bonds and highlights the importance placed on interconnectedness and extended kinship networks within the culture."

Apple is set to revolutionize the laptop scene with the introduction of its latest MacBook Pro powered by the M3 chip, which is expected to be based on TSMC's latest 3nm process technology. This advancement aims at enhancing both performance and power efficiency significantly. The M3 chip maintains an 8-core CPU configuration similar to the M2, yet it's anticipated to provide substantial improvements upon its release​1​.

The M3 series includes the base M3 chip, and extends to the more powerful M3 Pro and M3 Max chips. They represent the pinnacle of personal computing chips, being the industry’s first 3-nanometer chipsets. They introduce a next-generation GPU architecture, promising dramatic performance enhancements, a faster CPU and Neural Engine, and an increase in unified memory support​2​.

Specifically, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip is touted not just for handling everyday tasks with ease but also for delivering outstanding sustained performance for professional applications and gaming. This makes it an ideal tool for creative professionals, students, and entrepreneurs alike​3​.

In terms of technical specifications, the M3 chip comprises an 8-core CPU with four performance and four efficiency cores, alongside a 10-core GPU. It features hardware-accelerated ray tracing, a 16-core Neural Engine, and a 100GB/s memory bandwidth. The media engine supports hardware-accelerated H.264, HEVC, ProRes, and ProRes RAW video encode and decode engines​4​.

For those requiring even more robust performance, the M3 Pro chip builds upon the M3's capabilities by providing additional unified memory for more demanding applications, capable of handling gigapixel panoramas, compiling vast amounts of code, and editing multiple streams of 8K video. It can be configured with up to 36GB of unified memory and supports up to two external displays​​.

Moreover, these new models boast the longest battery life ever seen in a Mac. Specifically, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip can last up to 22 hours when watching movies, making it a powerhouse for both work and entertainment​​.

Performance-wise, the M3 silicon upgrade is expected to deliver speeds that are 50% faster than the M1 models and offer an 11x speed boost over the fastest Intel-based MacBook Pros previously available​7.

What was the first word that humans ever said?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JbtApI7Aao,magnify,Entertainment,"['linguistics', 'fun facts', 'history time', 'bible study', 'christianity']",2023-12-03T14:58:09.357Z,"The origins of language, including the first words spoken by humans, is a matter of much speculation and debate, as the emergence of language predates any written records by tens of thousands of years, and probably more. That said, there are several theories and hypotheses about how language might have started:

Bow-wow. The bow-wow or cuckoo theory, which Müller attributed to the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder, saw early words as imitations of the cries of beasts and birds. This theory, believed to be derived from onomatopoeia, relates the meaning of the sound to the actual sound formulated by the speaker.

Pooh-pooh. The Pooh-Pooh theory saw the first words as emotional interjections and exclamations triggered by pain, pleasure, surprise and so on. These sounds were all produced on sudden intakes of breath, which is unlike any other language. Unlike emotional reactions, spoken language is produced on the exhale, so the sounds contained in this form of communication are unlike those used in normal speech production, which makes this theory a less plausible one for language acquisition.

Ding-dong. Müller suggested what he called the Ding-Dong theory, which states that all things have a vibrating natural resonance, echoed somehow by man in his earliest words. Words are derived from the sound associated with their meaning; for example, “crash became a word for thunder, boom for explosion.” This theory also heavily relies on the concept of onomatopoeia.

Yo-he-ho. The yo-he-ho theory saw language emerging out of collective rhythmic labor, the attempt to synchronize muscular effort resulting in sounds such as heave alternating with sounds such as ho. Believed to be derived from the basis of human collaborative efforts, this theory states that humans needed words, which might have started off as chanting, to communicate. This need could have been to ward off predators, or served as a unifying battle cry.

Ta-ta. This did not feature in Max Müller's list, having been proposed in 1930 by Sir Richard Paget.[95] According to the ta-ta theory, humans made the earliest words by tongue movements that mimicked manual gestures, rendering them audible."

Lyrics:

Happy Christmas

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby
Do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year
It doesn't surprise me

Merry Christmas

I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying ""I love you""
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love. You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
I gave you my heart
A man under cover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone special

Special
Someone
Someone
I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone special

Who give me something in return
I'll give it to someone—
Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone—

I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone special

I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day
I thought you were someone special

Gave you my heart

I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone—

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
You gave it away

I'll give it to someone—
I'll give it to someone—"

Lyrics:
i was numb in the face
this night is way too long
gave you a little taste
but you wanted- wanted more
from me from me
but i've given all i can
and it's never enough
i was waiting all day
for a train that didn't come
there's something that you just
didn't have to say
cuz it was written on your face
hidden under tongues
on the way back to my place

are you loving me for me?
or just loving the idea of it?
are you loving me for me?
or just loving the idea of it?
i want something more than this
aaah
i want something more than this
aaah

i tried to show you signs
that we wouldn't make it out
i sat behind the side
i admit i was
looking for a way out
confided in a friend
i sugarcoated things i shouldn't have said
this day in day out day in
oh it's never gonna end

are you loving me for me?
or just loving the idea of it?
are you loving me for me?
or just loving the idea of it?
i want something more than this
aaah

i want something more than this
Aaah

are you loving-
loving me for me?
or just loving the idea of it?
are you loving me for me?
or just loving the idea of it?
i want something more than this
aaah
i want something more than this
aaah

KENNY BEATS & ZACK FOX FREESTYLE | The Cave: Episode 5,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSSLqHJzy6Y,Kenny Beats,Music,[''],2023-12-02T17:09:20.079Z,"Zack Fox is on The Cave this week. He is perhaps best known for his work on the Manhattan Project under J. Robert Oppenheimer, his involvement in Supreme Court case Korematsu v. United States, and of course his role as host of Chef’s Table on Netflix. Today he gives us mental illness bars, Gaza bars, dick in Doritos dust bars, among many other pressing and controversial modern issues. He is not afraid to say what needs to be said about dipping his balls in thousand island dressing, despite much opposition and pressure from both the Democratic party and the GOP. “We will not be silenced,” declared a spokesman from his team earlier this week during a press conference. But where would Zack’s mission be without the support of Kenny Beats, who somehow put together a soundscape reminiscent of our lord and savior Jesus Christ crip-walking for three days straight on his way back from crucifixion. It is only through the magic of collaboration between the two that we as members of the audience are welcomed to the proverbial meat show.

The Cave is a bi-weekly freestyle series hosted by Kenny Beats featuring a new artist each episode. One 10 minute beat from Kenny, 16-32 bars from a friend, every other week.

KENNY BEATS & DENZEL CURRY FREESTYLE | The Cave: Episode 12,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWenb9Noq_A,Kenny Beats,Music,"['kenny beats', 'dont over over think shit', 'dont', 'over', 'think', 'shit', 'kenny', 'beats', 'denzel', 'curry', 'the cave']",2023-12-02T16:54:56.416Z,"As devastating as it sounds, we have finally come upon the season finale of The Cave. It was just this past March that we released the first episode of this show, with the intention of showing people some of the personalities and antics that take place daily at Kenny’s illustrious studio. It is meant to serve not only as entertainment, but also as inspiration for those who want to be creative with their friends. For that reason, the feel of this show is intentionally DIY, not slick and over-produced, not over-thought. This was all conceptualized, designed, produced, and edited in-house by the DOTS family. That is all to say, you can do it too, using the people you have around you and tools that are already available.

Capping it all off is Florida’s Denzel Curry, who for the first time in show history, brought no one with him. We get an education in the late Ceddy Bu terminology, new instances of the now recurring theme of Kenny ignoring notifications from rappers while at the computer, and one of the most monumental-sounding freestyles we’ve witnessed on the show.

Until next time, hope you enjoyed the memorable moments of The Cave at the expense of Kenny’s psychological stability.

And at his behest, the honorable Kenneth Beats III. Kenny, who is definitely and most certainly not a member of any state police force or federal law enforcement agency administered by the Department of Justice, puts together an instrumental of global significance with massive geopolitical implications. Vince then effortlessly dismantles the Kenny Beat and continues on with his life through the exit door of The Cave. The pair behind classic 2018 album FM! does not disappoint, nor would you have ever expected them to. Just another day on the most compelling show on YouTube.

In the cypher, Tunechi calls out Baby around the 10:07 mark. After paying homage to 2Pac, the YM head honcho raps, ""I say hit em up to my daddy b**** a**,"" apparently referring to Birdman. Further, Weezy adds more fuel to the fire mentioning ""blood all in the fucking baby food,"" which can be interpreted in multiple ways. For his part, Flow extended his beef with Young Thug, rapping, ""Young motherf***ing Money / These my motherf***ing brothers not my f***ing hubbies.""

"The Secret Formula for ""Likable"" Characters",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDC2SH0Xx-A,magnify,Entertainment,"['fun facts', 'writing', 'screenwriting', 'psychology', 'breaking bad', 'cinema', 'film theory']",2023-12-02T16:44:40.237Z,"In the world of storytelling, some of the most captivating characters are those who, despite their flaws or challenging personalities, manage to win over the audience's affection. Think of characters like Tony Stark from the Marvel Universe, or Sherlock Holmes from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous series. These characters are not traditionally 'nice', yet they remain incredibly likable. This phenomenon can be better understood through Eric Edson's theory of character likability, as presented in his book ""The Story Solution.""

Edson proposes that a character becomes likable by possessing at least five out of nine positive traits. These include: courage, suffering an unfair injury, skill, humor, being nice, being in danger, loved by friends and family, hardworking, and obsession. The combination of these traits creates a complex and relatable character.  This framework helps explain why even morally ambiguous characters can be appealing."

M3 MacBook Pro hidden fix,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNnDgeu-5Do,Alex Ziskind,Science & Technology,"['apple', 'apple silicon chip', 'apple silicon mac', 'apple silicon macbook', 'apple silicon macbook pro', 'm2 macbook pro unboxing', 'macbook pro', 'm3', 'm3 pro', 'm3 macbook', 'm3 pro macbook']",2023-12-02T15:18:38.428Z,"The new M3 MacBook Pros have a secret hidden unannounced fix.

Apple is set to revolutionize the laptop scene with the introduction of its latest MacBook Pro powered by the M3 chip, which is expected to be based on TSMC's latest 3nm process technology. This advancement aims at enhancing both performance and power efficiency significantly. The M3 chip maintains an 8-core CPU configuration similar to the M2, yet it's anticipated to provide substantial improvements upon its release​1​.

The M3 series includes the base M3 chip, and extends to the more powerful M3 Pro and M3 Max chips. They represent the pinnacle of personal computing chips, being the industry’s first 3-nanometer chipsets. They introduce a next-generation GPU architecture, promising dramatic performance enhancements, a faster CPU and Neural Engine, and an increase in unified memory support​2​.

Specifically, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip is touted not just for handling everyday tasks with ease but also for delivering outstanding sustained performance for professional applications and gaming. This makes it an ideal tool for creative professionals, students, and entrepreneurs alike​3​.

In terms of technical specifications, the M3 chip comprises an 8-core CPU with four performance and four efficiency cores, alongside a 10-core GPU. It features hardware-accelerated ray tracing, a 16-core Neural Engine, and a 100GB/s memory bandwidth. The media engine supports hardware-accelerated H.264, HEVC, ProRes, and ProRes RAW video encode and decode engines​4​.

For those requiring even more robust performance, the M3 Pro chip builds upon the M3's capabilities by providing additional unified memory for more demanding applications, capable of handling gigapixel panoramas, compiling vast amounts of code, and editing multiple streams of 8K video. It can be configured with up to 36GB of unified memory and supports up to two external displays​​.

Moreover, these new models boast the longest battery life ever seen in a Mac. Specifically, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip can last up to 22 hours when watching movies, making it a powerhouse for both work and entertainment​​.

Performance-wise, the M3 silicon upgrade is expected to deliver speeds that are 50% faster than the M1 models and offer an 11x speed boost over the fastest Intel-based MacBook Pros previously available​7.

===========================================

I Love Louis Cole lyrics:


Let me say good morning my friend
About last night, I don't know how it ended
I can't find my phone and I can't find my shoes
But nothing beat, being in a party with you

Let's do it all again
Let's do it again
Let's do it all again
Let's do it again

It's just more fun, when you come around
Even if I act up
You let me know that I'm not crazy
Crazy
Crazy

Yeah, I remember you were punching my friends
Made an oil spill that makes Exxon offended
Then you fell asleep on the laundry in my room
And this is why I love to party with you

Let's do it all again
Let's do it again

Let's do it all again
Let's do it again

When you're around, you know what to say
You brighten my day
I feel that it's crazy
When you're around
When you're around

Written by Stephen Lee Bruner (a/k/a Thundercat) / Louis Cole

This isn't one of them. They were one of the first Japanese laptop manufacturer's and they made some awesome computer. I personally had one in 2010 that I have fond memories of playing Team Fortress 2 on, it had an i7 and Nvidia Graphics chip. I had to run a fan INTO the heatsink so that it wouldn't shut down once it reached 100c. But the build quality was awesome and the keyboard was a pleasure to type on. What happened? Greed. Toshiba began losing money and started cheaping out on materials and build quality. This POS Satellite is the product of that. Shortly after this, they sold their laptop division to Sharp, who further gutted it and changed the name to Dynabook. There's your history lesson."

Don’t Visit Santa Cruz | #adayinalife #vlog  #fulltimetravel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-X8d57UnQ0,Static CamperVan,People & Blogs,[''],2023-12-02T14:36:45.804Z,"#vanlife #vlog #adayinalife 
For years I’ve heard good things about Santa Cruz California. But I haven’t been to this area since I was a kid. 
My verdict is not to visit Santa Cruz. It’s a beautiful, safe, extremely friendly and peaceful city. If you visit, you won’t want to ever leave. 
Today I parked at The Hook, a popular surfing spot in the Please Point neighborhood. 
After making a quick breakfast burrito, I got out for a walk along the cliffs overlooking the ocean. 
Santa Cruz is a very walkable city. So I did a lot of walking. On the walk, I stopped in a Cat & Cloud Coffee and ordered a drip coffee and a flat white. Both were excellent as was the service. 
Later in the day I walked down to Capitola Beach as the sun was setting. And I couldn’t help gushing over how amazing this city is. 
Don’t visit Santa. You will be smitten and won’t ever want to leave.

Over the years, I’ve learned you don’t need to have a big skill set to build your own campervan. And that living as a minimalist and utilizing solar power can be a less expensive way to live. I’ve also learned that a minivan can be a very comfortable home. 
Please follow along as I document my journey.

In an effort to help viewers search for the best prices on products that I use, I’ve started an Amazon Influencer link:
https://www.amazon.com/shop/staticcampervan
My hope is that you will use this link as a starting point to search for the best price. If you're looking for an item that isn't listed, feel free to drop me a question or comment and I will do my best to find a link.

The Biggest Announcement from OpenAI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vINEESYPseo,Cleo Abram,News & Politics,[''],2023-12-02T14:09:43.977Z,"Here are the 3 huge announcements from OpenAI that you should know about...

1) You might have heard you can BUILD YOUR OWN GPTs, meaning you could make your own chatbot to be really helpful specific tasks, from explaining board game rules to teaching math. The craziest part is, you don’t need to know how to code to make one.

2) OpenAI said they’ll pay the legal fees of companies who use their products and get sued for copyright infringement, so expect to see some interesting court cases there.

3) ChatGPT can now handle up to 300 pages of information, 16 times more than before.

It’s not just OpenAI’s tool that’s getting more powerful. Others are too! If you want to learn more about what's really happening with AI, we made a longer episode all about it - complete with an interview with former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.

Two Bible Mandela Effects 🤯,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgVUNLONTRg,magnify,Entertainment,"['mandela effect', 'languages', 'language learning', 'bible', 'history time', 'sociology']",2023-11-30T23:00:21.231Z,"... are we living in an alternate timeline now?  

Many people 

The phrase ""the lion shall lie down with the lamb"" is a popular cultural reference that many people attribute to the Bible. However, this exact phrase does not actually appear in the Bible.

The phrase is likely a conflation of two separate verses in the book of Isaiah. The first is Isaiah 11:6, which states: ""The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.""

The second verse is Isaiah 65:25, which reads: ""The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord.""

It's possible that the popular misquote of the Bible has arisen from the fact that both of these verses depict unlikely pairs of animals living together in peace. However, it's worth noting that the actual verses refer to different animals"

More about Gianmarco:
Gianmarco Soresi is a stand-up comedian, actor, and a little too much for some people. He’s told jokes on The Late Late Show with James Corden, Comedy Central, Netflix’s Bonding, Don’t Tell, The Real Housewives of New York for some reason, and he was a JFL New Face in 2022. He’s acted in Billy Crystal’s Here Today, Hustlers, The Last OG, and in his theater days shared the stage with some people who’ve gone on to become huge real estate agents. You can see him post the kind of crowdwork clips that are arguably destroying the artform of stand-up comedy everywhere @gianmarcosoresi and he obviously has a podcast called The Downside with Gianmarco Soresi.🎤

Which Animal Knows the Most Words?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SXf-acQO0c,magnify,Entertainment,"['languages', 'sociology', 'zoology', 'fun facts', 'animal training']",2023-11-30T17:05:54.017Z,"When it comes to understanding words in English, the scope narrows significantly. While some animals can learn to associate specific sounds with objects or commands, their comprehension of English words is limited. However, certain species have shown remarkable language comprehension abilities.

Dogs, for instance, have been trained to recognize a substantial number of words, especially when it comes to commands and basic objects. They can understand verbal cues and respond accordingly. Similarly, some parrots have demonstrated the ability to learn and associate a significant vocabulary of English words with their corresponding meanings.

In terms of primates, great apes, such as chimpanzees and bonobos, have shown the ability to comprehend and use symbolic languages, including American Sign Language (ASL). They can learn hundreds of signs and use them to communicate with humans effectively.

While these animals exhibit impressive linguistic abilities, it's important to note that their understanding of English words may differ from human comprehension. Their grasp might be more limited, focusing primarily on specific commands, objects, or concepts associated with their training."

This system, inscribed on temple walls, stelae, and countless papyrus scrolls, was a blend of alphabet, ideograms, and pictograms.

Alphabetic Signs:
In hieroglyphics, alphabetic signs represent single sounds, much like the letters of the modern alphabet. These signs were relatively few and were used to spell out the sounds of words.

Ideograms:
Ideograms, or logograms, represent words or morphemes (units of meaning). For instance, a symbol of a man could stand for the word ""man."" An ideogram essentially captures an idea with a single sign.

Pictograms:
Pictograms are signs that represent objects by visually resembling them. They're similar to ideograms but are more direct visual representations of the objects they signify.

As civilizations evolved and intermingled, there was a need for a simpler, more efficient way of communicating. Several factors led to the decline of hieroglyphics in favor of pure alphabet systems."

"The Reason We Say ""OUCH!""",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioZtwTKu4s8,magnify,Entertainment,"['fun facts', 'langauges', 'linguistics', 'psychology', 'culture', 'world traveller']",2023-11-30T04:55:47.708Z,"The expression of pain is a universal human experience, but the way it's vocalized varies across cultures, illustrated by the different exclamations for ""ouch"" around the world. This variation is a fascinating intersection of linguistics, culture, and biology.

In English, ""ouch"" is commonly used. In Spanish, it's often ""ay"" while in French, ""aïe"" is a common utterance.

Biologically, the vocalization of pain is an instinctive response, but the specific sounds used are learned. Infants across the world initially exhibit similar pain responses, but as they grow and acquire language, their expressions align with their linguistic and cultural surroundings."

In case when your laptop freezes because of lack of memory, you need to upgrade RAM. Sometimes you can just add some more RAM cards to free slot, and sometimes you need to replace RAM card, when there is no free slots for new. But in any case you need RAM card same type that is installed to you laptop: it's always SO-DIMM (laptop type of memory) and other characteristics depends on your laptop and RAM installed in it. In any case, I will place links to most likely RAM cards that must fit to your laptop in description and in 1st comment of this video.

AtlasOS for Windows 11! This is insane

LIKE and SUBSCRIBE if you're new!  Hope you guys all enjoy :)

In today's video I try out the NEW Atlas OS which has recently come out with Windows 11 support. Lots of people use AtlasOS thanks to my videos on it and today it's got even better we're going to be trying the NEW Atlas OS on my Low-End PC

AtlasOS is an Optimised version of Windows with minimal background Processes,  Reduced latency and will help improve our FPS and performance on Minecraft, The project is open source and is install slightly different to other OS that I've featured on my channel

If you are always looking for a good OS like I am then I think I may of found it, Let me know if you want me to compare this to other custom OS's such as ReviOS or Windows AME

This version of Windows optimises Windows settings, removes all  bloatware from the OS and removes privacy intrusive telemetry services from Microsoft.

The specs of the PC I'm using to run AtlasOS: 
Intel Core i5 4460 CPU, 8GB DDR3 RAM, GTX 1060, 500GB SSD

Also note: do not use the CTT tool to tweak AtlasOS like I did otherwise it may lead to broken installs. I simply tried for entertainment purposes as it is by no means by main system.

Share One Mouse/Keyboard Between Windows & Mac with Barrier,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtYOaH7deeo,Kevin's Guides,Science & Technology,[''],2023-11-28T14:10:20.601Z,"How to use a free program called Barrier to share your mouse and keyboard between multiple computers that are next to each other. In this situation, I'm sharing a mouse/keyboard between my Windows desktop and my Mac Mini.

Barrier's Page on GitHub: https://github.com/debauchee/barrier
Check out my website: https://kevinsguides.com
Tip Jar: https://kevinsguides.com/tips

Possible Troubleshooting Steps - Try each one and see if any of them resolve the issues.

0) Go to Barrier - Show Log - on both client and server. See if it tells you more info on why the connection is failing.
1) Make sure your computers are both on the same network. I find it works best if they're both either wired via ethernet or on the same WiFi.
2) Double check IPs are typed right. If multiple IPs are displayed on the server, try the next IPs in the list.
3) Double check screen name of client is typed right in server config, exactly as it shows on client.
4) Double check SSL disabled both on server and client
5) Try a different port in server settings
6) Try enabling port forwarding in the web settings of your router. Forward the selected port number to the server IP.
7) Allow local traffic to the port in your servers firewall settings, and make sure barrier is not blocked in any firewall settings on both client and server."

It gave you life and it stains your bed casings
Crumpled tissues on stacks of red pages
Close,
Close your eyes

Crumpled tissues on stacks of red pages

How to Test for Hard Water in Your Home,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdSeolFu928,HomeWater101,People & Blogs,"['home improvement', 'DIY', 'rennovation', 'do it yourself', 'home', 'hard water', 'soft water', 'water testing', 'water', 'hair', 'skin', 'nails', 'dry skin']",2023-11-26T23:30:49.468Z,"There are 3 easy and cost-effective ways you can test for hard water in your home. We explain the methods so you know if you have hard water.

(0:12) The first method is to go online and check with your city. They provide an annual Water Quality Report that is available for anybody to read. They tell you where your water comes from and what’s in it. They also include your area’s hard water number so you know what water softening solution you need.

(0:30) You can test for hard water in your home by taking a clean and clear bottle. Fill one-third of the bottle with tap water. Then, pour a few drops of pure Castile liquid soap into the bottle and shake. Make sure you use pure liquid soap because it doesn’t contain additives that will create suds in hard water. 

If you have soft water, your bottle should still be filled a third of the way with water and two-thirds filled with bubbles from the soap.

If you have hard water, the water in the bottle will be cloudy and there will be a thin layer of bubbles. 

(0:58) To find how hard your water is, you’ll need a test kit. You can get a free hard water test kit by going to https://homewater101.com/free-water-test.

Fill a glass with cold water and then dip your test strip in the glass for 3-5 seconds before removing. Compare the color on your test strip with the hard water color chart, and that will give you your home’s hard water number in grains per gallon.

This chart ranges from 0 to 60. 60 will be a dark red color. 

Knowing your specific number will help you find the right softener for your home. You can shop for water softeners by going to https://www.ecopurehome.com/water-softeners/water-softening-systems  and find the solution that’s best for you.

Apple made things a little confusing - with the 15” M2 MacBook Air. When you first look at it, $1,299 is an incredible value for a super thin, light and powerful 15” Macbook. But once you start adding unified memory and internal storage - does it make more sense - even to the everyday user - to go with the 14” MacBook Pro?  Let's talk about it. Also, I know prices are different around the world, so let me know in the comments section where you’re from, and what the base model of each one costs where you live.

Best Starfield PC Build for 1080p, 1440p, and 4K gaming. Starfield launches on September 6th, with early access on September 1st. We review the AMD Starfield Bundle which offers a free Starfield Game with the purchase of select Radeon and Ryzen CPUs. We cover three Starfield PC Build guides including a $600 Starfield PC Build for 1080p, a $900 Starfield Gaming PC Build for 1440p, and a $1250 Starfield PC Build for 4K with a $1500 Starfield PC Build for high FPS at 4K. Each Starfield PC Build targets 60 FPS using the high preset which includes FSR by default at the recommended resolution. At launch, Starfield performs significantly better on Radeon GPUs, though you can substitute NVIDIA GPUs (note that there is no NVIDIA Starfield bundle, so you'll need to buy a Ryzen 7000 CPU or buy the game separately). Looking for the best pc build for Starfield? This guide is your answer!

Want a skinny and ultra-light Windows notebook that's powerful enough for creative shenanigans, and great for movies? The Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Pro is a solid choice in 2023.

This review model laptop was the Core i5 version with 16GB RAM. In the UK, you can grab the Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Pro from £1349, while the 360 model costs £500 extra. You can get Samsung credit if you pre-order now with this link: https://howl.me/ci6wU5z3ei0

Media fans and creators will love the Galaxy Book 3 Pro, which boasts dependable performance thanks to Intel's 13th Gen processor tech. If you want dedicated graphics, then check out Samsung's Ultra model instead, while the Book3 Pro 360 boasts a touchscreen and stylus.

Battery life is good enough to last you hours, plus the ports serve up dual Thunderbolt connections. That AMOLED display is a stunner, and the quad speaker setup belts out audio at an impressive volume.

Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is the first game to capture the bright, vibrant style pioneered by Jet Set Radio since 2002's Jet Set Radio Future. BRCF finally gave JSRF fans an updated version of the iconic and unique blend of skating, rollerblading and graffiti, all put together in a package so visually stunning and colorful, unlike anything we've seen in games recently. Bomb Rush Cyberfunk also features an incredible soundtrack worthy of JSR's iconic OST, mixing hip hop, J-pop, funk, electronic dance and more. The gameplay of Bomb Rush Cyberfunk is fast paced, rhythmic and fun, and stringing together combos of tricks and grinds to the beat of funky songs is super satisfying.

I REPLACED My Laptop With A Virtual Reality Headset (Meta Quest Pro),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51IBgkw3GJI,Mike O'Brien,Science & Technology,[''],2023-11-21T18:28:25.739Z,"Can VR headsets actually replace computer monitors? I tried one for a few days to find out. There were some huge benefits, but also massive downsides and a lot of pain.

Please comment below with any questions you might have.  Thank you all for watching! I appreciate you!

ADDITIONAL REVIEW NOTES:
For the past few days, I replaced my laptop with a VR head set. You see, the new VR goggles from Meta, the Meta Quest Pro now have color cameras on it, so you can actually see your surroundings and get an augmented reality experience. Marques Brownlee pointed out that you could connect a desktop or laptop wirelessly and instead of having one small laptop display, you could have three massive displays surrounding your head. So how practical is this? Could you use it at work everyday, or in a small apartment, or perhaps while traveling on a plane or in a coffee shop? Well I wanted to find out, so I ordered a Meta Quest Pro and used it instead of my usual laptop display

Let’s start out with some concerns I had before starting

1) The battery life: 

You don’t actually need to worry about the battery because you can charge via usbC while using the headset

2) Camera quality and lag
Not really any significant lag that bothered me

You really can’t see your keyboard, so while typing is fine, I sometimes struggle to find the special characters like @#%^ on my macbook pro

Using workspace app, you can see your surroundings (and your laptop) or you can go to a different virtual workspace. The virtual is easier on they eyes, but then you can’t see your laptop or keyboard at all and you are just typing on a table - strange. They need a keyboard map

I am TERRIFIED that I will spill something on my laptop

Sometimes there is some lag in typing and mouse movement, but for the most part, I was impressed by how smooth everything was!

So those were my preconceived concerns and initial reactions when I started using it. So far, so good. None of them were really dealbreakers. Instead, there was plenty to like about this setup.

1) No screen glares from lights or windows
2) No distractions
Other people look kind of faceless
Surroundings were less interesting and less clear than display
Can’t use phone
More immersive and therefore more productive
3) It really works well! Much like actually having multiple monitors. They stay put perfectly, and even extensions like Magnet on Mac work to snap windows to different virtual displays
4) Insead of turning your head, you can turn the monitors. This is incredible. Just use hand gestures to bring each monitor in front of you - is this different from alt tab? I think so. It definitely takes some practice. Not a smooth experience for me yet
5) So I know I said I hate 360 audio, but this is a situation where it is cool. 

Which leads us into some hiccups and full blown problems

2) Hand and control gestures do not affect your computer at all - your normal mouse and keyboard do that

3) I think I need to wear earbuds if I plan to listen to music. The speakers on this headset are just ok. Passable for a tutorial or podcast, but I like to listen to music when I work (or listen to my own audio when editing)

4) This thing is heavy. While my head is comfortable, my neck is definitely feeling the strain from an extra 1.6lb on my head

5) The biggest issue of them all, and the reason I had to stop using this to replace my monitor

The 1800x1920 resolution is definitely not great. If you break that down to each computer display, I would say it is equivalent to about 720p display. My laptop is 4k and I am usually not this close to it. I really look forward to the day this kind of headset is 5k or better. 
 
For now, I just make all my browser tabs about 200%

Started working - let’s see how long I can work without eye pain
20 min - Loosening fit
45 min - Eyes feel like I am working on a 2005 CRT display. Same type of resolution, harsh brightness, and overall feel on my eyes. To continue, I am turning the brightness down to 50% and entering a lakeside workspace 
1 hr - I had to take a break. That really hurt my eyes

hope you'll enjoy cuz it took a long time to make (+ or - 5h) and it takes A LOT of space (45.38 GB). it's so heavy that i can't even read it on my pc without converting it to a very small and ugly size...

Special thanks to Autry who by chance randomly spotted me on the street and told me that Thundercat wanted to meet me ! I thought I would only talk to Thundercat briefly and exchange information for a future interview, instead  Autry brought Thundercat to  Neptoon Records, for an encounter that lasted a whole lot longer ! Incredible ! Doot doo !
