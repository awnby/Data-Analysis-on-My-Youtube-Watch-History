dropping this video on a sunday night yeah man i know what im doing we alllll getting depressed tonight

I'd been wanting to make this video for a while. Not sure if I like how it's turned out, but I'm glad that I at least attempted it. In my previous video I mentioned that I think mental health can be a very touchy subject in music, and I truly think Fantansyworld by Quadeca is one of the best depictions of it. It's a genuine masterpiece song to me. (i know i know im biased come fight me)

I didn't mean to haunt you turns one years old today and I wanted to do something for the occasion, cause why not. I'm surprised it took me this long to talk about Quadeca. Obviously I have already on the second channel but yeah figured I'd give this main channel treatment. 

SECOND CHANNEL GO SUB: @SenioAndFunnierFriends 

As for this channel, these last 2 videos have been interesting experiments and a bit of a change of pace. We'll see where I go from there. Next video will probably be a happy go lucky one lol

The Math behind (most) 3D games - Perspective Projection,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0_ONQQ5ZNM,Brendan Galea,Education,"['vulcan', 'perspective projection', '3d graphics', 'perspective matrix', 'vulcan api', 'vulkan graphics', 'vulcan 3d', 'frustum']",2023-11-20T23:57:20.584Z,"Perspective matrices  have been used behind the scenes since the inception of 3D gaming,  and the majority of vector libraries will have built-in helper functions to construct them for you. But what if you wanted to know the reasoning behind how these matrices are constructed.

I start off with a brief introduction of computer graphics and the key ideas behind 3D rendering. I differentiate between Image Order Rasterization typically used by Ray tracers, and object order rasterization as used in most video games. I then present an animated walkthrough showing the full derivation of both the orthographic and perspective projection matrices.

My derivation here is focused on the Vulkan API, but the reasoning applies just as well to other API's such as OpenGL or direct X, with the only notable differences being the size of the canonical viewing volumes, and the handedness and conventions of the xyz coordinate systems.

THE BEYOND: A Massive Leap For VR Headsets,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCXmv27o3AU,ThrillSeeker,Science & Technology,"['vr', 'virtual reality', 'quest 3', 'beyond', 'bigscreen beyond', 'valve index', 'thrillseeker', 'tuesday newsday', 'quest 2', 'quest', 'meta quest', 'oculus quest', 'VR games', 'VR headset', 'Best VR headset', 'Best VR games', 'ar', 'augmented reality']",2023-11-20T20:56:29.830Z,"Hello! 
This is probably the longest review period for any VR headset I have ever tried; for the past 6 months I've been using the beyond just about every single day. I've found a lot of positives- I really like the beyond, but it's not perfect and its certainly not for everyone. 

But It just might be the best PCVR headset available if you can stomach the price. I will be re-reviewing the Varjo Aero soon and Reviewing the Pimax Crystal as well. 

I hope you enjoy this video.

üßëüèª‚ÄçüíªHow I would learn coding if I started over: https://youtu.be/7JbvzKSFYQ

Hey everyone! üéÆ Ever felt the drag after a marathon gaming session? I've been there. In this video, I detail my personal experience from spending countless hours on video games to discovering the immersive world of coding. Through my journey, I've established a six-step framework designed to help passionate gamers like me transition from simply consuming content to creating it. This framework not only taught me coding but also helped me design, problem-solve, and craft my own narrative, reminiscent of my favorite games. If you've ever thought about reducing your gaming hours, diving into the rewarding realm of coding, or striking a harmonious balance between both worlds, then this video will resonate with you. Dive in as I discuss motivation, selecting the right coding language, the art of gamifying your coding journey, and so much more. Your transition from gaming to creating starts here!

Get my Social Interactions Handbook: https://shop.beacons.ai/niu.views/socialinteractionshandbookniuviews

*TIPS:*
- Soft and Sharp responses are only negatively experienced when imbalanced
- Imbalances = feeling INFERIOR or SUPERIOR
- INFERIORITY symptoms: people-pleasing, laughter-padding, white lies
- SUPERIORITY symptoms: reactiveness, judgement over observation, attachment
- YOUR ENERGY: what you embody inside and out - facial expressions, body language, tone, pitch, pace, words, intention, thoughts, emotions...

How to be SOFT and BALANCED:
1. Be intentional
2. Breathe
3. Be eye-level with others
4. Speak slower
5. Lift/lighten your tone
6. Ground your energy

How to be SHARP and BALANCED:
1. Be intentional
2. Breathe
3. Be eye-level with others
4. Be honest
5. Be definitive and open at the same time
6. Stay present and conscious

See my Instagram and TikTok for more examples on balanced Sharp vs Soft responses.

How to Turn Off Inverted Camera on iPhone 13: Step by Step,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXC3l7JK490,Solve Your Tech,Howto & Style,"['how to turn off inverted camera on iphone 13', 'how to turn off inverted camera iphone', 'how to change inverted camera on iphone', 'how to change inverted camera on iphone 13', 'how to turn off inverted camera on iphone 13 pro', 'how to turn off inverted camera on iphone 13 pro max']",2023-11-19T15:21:14.361Z,"Welcome to our authoritative guide on how to turn off the inverted camera feature on your iPhone 13. As a leading resource for all things Apple, we are confident in providing you with the most accurate and up-to-date information to help you make the most of your iPhone's capabilities.

Inverted camera mode can be a frustrating issue for iPhone 13 users, but fear not! We have the solution to this problem right at your fingertips. Our step-by-step tutorial will guide you through the process, ensuring you can quickly disable the inverted camera and get back to capturing moments with ease.

Why does the camera invert on the iPhone 13? The inverted camera effect occurs when the front-facing camera captures images and displays them as a mirror image. This feature, although intended to mimic the reflection you see in a mirror, can sometimes be undesirable. Whether you're taking selfies, making video calls, or using any app that utilizes the front camera, we understand the importance of having a non-inverted image.

To turn off the inverted camera on your iPhone 13, follow these simple steps:

1. Launch the Settings app on your iPhone 13.
2. Scroll down and tap on ""Camera.""
3. Under the Camera settings, find ""Mirror Front Camera.""
4. Toggle the switch next to ""Mirror Front Camera"" to the off position.

That's it! By turning off the ""Mirror Front Camera"" option, your iPhone 13's front-facing camera will capture images in a non-inverted manner, providing you with the desired outcome.

Now you can take stunning selfies, enjoy video chats, and use various apps that rely on the front camera without the annoyance of inverted images. Stay confident and in control of your iPhone 13's camera settings, and let your creativity flourish.

Remember, the steps provided here are specifically tailored for the iPhone 13. If you're using a different model, the process may vary slightly. However, our knowledgeable team is always ready to assist you with any specific questions or concerns you may have.

[Verse 1]
I see why you are stressed mhm
because you're no contest mhm

while i flex mhm, bad bitch that's to my left

know niggas that love techs, like geeks
know every spec, both cheeks i grab oh yes

don't care who got up next

[Verse 2]

i love black girls that listen to rock
fuck you thinking tryna put me in box

[Verse 3]
this ain't for containing, you stupid lil hoe
ain't no point, in saving when niggas up the score

New Voxel Engine Reveal - Crystal Islands Experiment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ptH79R53c0,John Lin,Gaming,"['voxels', 'tiny voxels', 'level of detail', 'microvoxels', 'unlimited detail', 'procedural generation', 'path tracing', 'ray tracing', 'rtx']",2023-11-18T20:49:04.649Z,"Follow me on Twitter for more updates: https://twitter.com/ProgrammerLin

This scene is composed entirely of voxels. What started as an innocent attempt at increasing the view distance evolved into a 4 month quest to achieve not only that, but rewrite a brand new voxel engine from the ground up that would feature:
- An 8x (512 cubic) detail increase with animation support, high compression rates, and per-voxel material attributes
- Fast collision detection that physics and player walking will utilize
- Full fracture and mutation of objects
- Improved path traced global illumination that features 5 bounces from the sun, atmosphere and all emissive objects
- A powerful asset pipeline that can utilize Quixel Megascans, PlantFactory/PlantCatalog's detailed vegetation, and other highly detailed polygon models after being converted and processed into voxels (all 3 seen in this video)
- Ray-traced world generation that could easily place trees, grass, flowers, and other assets (eg. crystals) in designated areas: eg. in sunlight, on cave walls, in big open areas, and so on
- A 10x speedup in rendering over the previous engine

Most of these features are showcased in the video. Of course, there are some kinks to work out, like you can see object intersections occurring or being placed in odd places, and the path traced denoiser is lacking a spatial filter, but I got too excited with how this looks that I couldn't wait any longer to share. The effective world size here is 256K^3 and the island is generated once upon startup (like Terraria for instance), which takes about a minute. Things won't look this chaotic in whatever the final version is, as it's more a feature test than anything else.

To those who prefer the charm of the old engine, there is a low-detail mode that will be toggleable. More likely than not, this level of detail will be reserved for RTX graphics cards, and the low-detail mode will be the fall back for older ones. I don't have exact spec predictions yet, because there are so many tweaks to be made like level-of-detail threshold, lighting refresh rates, and the world size itself, so general performance requirements remain to be outlined.

Stay tuned for more updates, as in the future we'll soon see that this world is dynamic and not just there to be looked at. Rigid body physics will make a return, so will fluid dynamics eventually, and really everything seen here is only the beginning. Thank you to everyone who supports this project, and doesn't leave mean comments calling out how I keep saying the next video will be the official announcement. Soon(tm) ;)"
What are Voxels and why are they so cool?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWU8t0CpNQA,chromerot,Gaming,"['voxel', 'ray tracing', 'voxels', 'voxel art', 'voxel tutorial', 'voxel models', 'voxel physics', 'voxel graphics', 'minecraft voxel', 'tiny voxels', 'voxel 3d', 'learn voxels', 'voxel mod', 'what are voxels', 'voxel sandbox', 'voxel cabin']",2023-11-18T20:34:45.723Z,"John Lin's channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM2RhfMLoLqG24e_DYgTQeA

Voxel graphics use a completely different way of modeling and rendering objects in games than we're used to seeing in modern AAA games. A huge majority of video games use Polygons to render the visuals. These are millions of tiny triangles connected together to form surfaces. Voxels, or volumetric pixels, don't use any triangles but are instead tiny cubes (3D pixels) grouped together to form objects that have actual volume. Voxels were mostly used in the 90s with games such as Outcast, but have barely evolved since, unlike Polygons which continue to push boundaries with projects like Unreal Engine 5. The only notable example of a recent Voxel based game is Teardown, but John Lin's ray traced procedurally generated sandbox physics based voxel game looks promising."

FIX: C/C++ PROGRAMS NOT RUNNING PROPERLY ON VS CODE (EASY FIX) | 100% WORKING,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8g8GvqMxHc,Raunak Kumar,Science & Technology,"['FIX: C/C++ PROGRAMS NOT RUNNING PROPERLY ON VS CODE (EASY FIX) | 100% WORKING', 'While compiling the code we may get the errors like', 'compilation terminated.', 'gcc.exe: error: t: No such file or directory', 'gcc.exe: error: tt.cpp: No such file or directory', 'gcc.exe: error: tt: No such file or directory', 'gcc.exe: fatal error: no input files', 'fix for the errors that we get during the compilation stage while running C/C++ programs on VS Code.', 'vscode', 'c program', 'c++program', 'g++.exe: error']",2023-11-18T17:24:36.916Z,"#Read the description too until the end to get rid of all the errors!!
While compiling the code we may get the errors like:

g++.exe: error: t: No such file or directory
g++.exe: error: tt.cpp: No such file or directory
g++.exe: error: tt: No such file or directory
g++.exe: fatal error: no input files
compilation terminated.

This error usually creeps in when we try to compile a file that contains -spaces- within its name. For example: ""hello world.cpp"" such a filename is not allowed by g++/gcc compilers. You can instead use "" _ ""(underscore) to write the filename. For eg: the above file will compile successfully if written as ""hello_world.cpp"".

This video shows a further fix for the errors that we get during the compilation stage while running C/C++ programs on VS Code.
I hope that after watching this video all your doubts will be clear and you will enjoy your C/C++ journey on VS CODE ahead!
Happy Coding!!

About MF DOOM:

Daniel Dumile, best known as MF Doom or simply Doom, was a British-American rapper and record producer. He was noted for his intricate wordplay, signature metal mask, and ""supervillain"" stage persona. Dumile became a major figure in underground and alternative hip hop in the 2000s. Born in London, he moved to Long Island, New York, at a young age. Dumile began his career as a member of KMD in 1988, performing as Zev Love X. After the group disbanded in 1993, he reemerged in the late 1990s, adopting the MF Doom persona and rarely making unmasked public appearances. 

From 2003 to 2005, Dumile released four solo albums and three collaborative albums, including the critically acclaimed ""Mm..Food"" (2004) under the MF Doom moniker. He also released solo albums under the pseudonym King Geedorah and as Viktor Vaughn. ""Madvillainy"" (2004), recorded with producer Madlib as Madvillain, is considered Dumile's magnum opus and a landmark album in hip hop. In 2005, he collaborated with producer Danger Mouse on ""The Mouse and the Mask"" as Danger Doom.

Despite living most of his life in the United States, Dumile never gained American citizenship. In 2010, he was denied reentry after an international tour. He then relocated to London and primarily worked in collaboration with other artists in his final years, releasing albums with Jneiro Jarel (as JJ Doom), Bishop Nehru (NehruvianDoom), and Czarface (Czarface Meets Metal Face and the posthumous Super What?).

How long would it take YOU to figure out how to *unlock* this 4.0 Difficulty geocache? üëÄ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9lfeXStlr0,Hullsome,Gaming,[''],2023-11-18T14:34:47.389Z,"Embarking on a geocaching adventure in Reno, NV, I stumbled upon a cleverly concealed treasure tucked away in the branches of a nondescript tree. The coordinates led me to a fake birdhouse that seemed ordinary at first glance. Intrigued, I inspected the surroundings, searching for the elusive geocache.

Upon closer examination, I discovered a hidden compartment within the birdhouse. My excitement grew as I realized this was no ordinary cache. My attention was drawn to a small magnet attached to the side of the container. The challenge became apparent ‚Äî using the provided magnet, I needed to skillfully navigate the key upwards to unlock the secrets hidden within.

The task proved more intricate than expected, requiring patience and precision. Multiple attempts ensued as I grappled with the magnet, each effort bringing me closer to unraveling the mystery. With determination and a touch of finesse, I successfully maneuvered the key into my grasp, unlocking the geocache's concealed compartment.

The reward was not just the physical trinkets inside, but the satisfaction of overcoming a unique and thoughtfully designed geocaching challenge, making this find in Reno a memorable and exhilarating experience."

so after finishing muck in my video ""Adding a Dragon Boss to my Game Because Steam is Mad at me"", i learned a lot about making multiplayer games, networking, and more. so when Squid Game become popular on Netflix, I knew I had to turn Squid Game into an actual multiplayer game. I created this game in my video: ""I Made Squid Game, But it's a Multiplayer Game"", and called it Crab Game. But Crab Game got millions of downloads (10m at the time of writing this), and now netflix might be out to get me, so i have to update crab game and make it different, so netflix doesnt destroy me for copying squid game. haha cool

So he challenged me to make a multiplayer survival game, and i had to prove him wrong of course. last time we made a vr game, check it out somewhere lol. Im gonna use the Unity game enigine to make it. I've made a few multiplayer games in the past, but nothing on this scale. it's heavily inspired by a bunch of survival multiplayer / roguelike games that i enjoy, like Valheim, Minecraft, Rush, Risk of rain & more. It's pretty scuffed, might get some updates out in the future. thanks for watching :)

Apple is set to revolutionize the laptop scene with the introduction of its latest MacBook Pro powered by the M3 chip, which is expected to be based on TSMC's latest 3nm process technology. This advancement aims at enhancing both performance and power efficiency significantly. The M3 chip maintains an 8-core CPU configuration similar to the M2, yet it's anticipated to provide substantial improvements upon its release‚Äã1‚Äã.

The M3 series includes the base M3 chip, and extends to the more powerful M3 Pro and M3 Max chips. They represent the pinnacle of personal computing chips, being the industry‚Äôs first 3-nanometer chipsets. They introduce a next-generation GPU architecture, promising dramatic performance enhancements, a faster CPU and Neural Engine, and an increase in unified memory support‚Äã2‚Äã.

Specifically, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip is touted not just for handling everyday tasks with ease but also for delivering outstanding sustained performance for professional applications and gaming. This makes it an ideal tool for creative professionals, students, and entrepreneurs alike‚Äã3‚Äã.

In terms of technical specifications, the M3 chip comprises an 8-core CPU with four performance and four efficiency cores, alongside a 10-core GPU. It features hardware-accelerated ray tracing, a 16-core Neural Engine, and a 100GB/s memory bandwidth. The media engine supports hardware-accelerated H.264, HEVC, ProRes, and ProRes RAW video encode and decode engines‚Äã4‚Äã.

For those requiring even more robust performance, the M3 Pro chip builds upon the M3's capabilities by providing additional unified memory for more demanding applications, capable of handling gigapixel panoramas, compiling vast amounts of code, and editing multiple streams of 8K video. It can be configured with up to 36GB of unified memory and supports up to two external displays‚Äã‚Äã.

Moreover, these new models boast the longest battery life ever seen in a Mac. Specifically, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip can last up to 22 hours when watching movies, making it a powerhouse for both work and entertainment‚Äã‚Äã.

Performance-wise, the M3 silicon upgrade is expected to deliver speeds that are 50% faster than the M1 models and offer an 11x speed boost over the fastest Intel-based MacBook Pros previously available‚Äã7.

I love turn-based combat. Most of the time. But there are plenty of pain points that all kinds of games with turn-based combat keep running into. Fixing those points doesn't have to mean changing what makes the style great. Let's talk about some common game design problems turn-based combat games run into and how you can make JRPGs, tactics games, and more the best they can be.

In this video, I'll show you how to turn off the click to reveal desktop feature in macOS Sonoma. Are you tired of accidentally revealing your desktop every time you click? Well, I've got a workaround for you!
Join me as I guide you through a few simple steps to disable this feature. Open the Settings and head over to ""Desktop & Dock."" From there, locate ""Desktop & Stage Manager"" and change the option for ""click wallpaper to reveal desktop"" to ""Only in Stage Manager."" It's that easy!
Now, here's the thing. If you're a Stage Manager user, you might encounter a small issue. But don't worry, I've got a solution for you too. Just go back to ""Desktop & Stage Manager"" in the Settings and choose to ""Show Items"" only in Stage Manager and/or on the desktop.
By following these steps, you'll have full control over when your desktop reveals itself, without activating Expose every time you click. Say goodbye to that annoying feature and enjoy a more personalized Mac experience.

My page will be un-launched at the end of this year, and I hope to start fresh on Discord, of all things!

The nature of building a community behind a paywall makes Patreon a difficult platform to get engagement on. Unfortunately, that's a really important part of being an artist and a content creator-- getting feedback from your audience on what's working and what's not. 

Compare that to Discord, a platform literally MADE for having conversations, and the difference is like night and day.

Over 18 hours of work.
I made it because I wanted to learn some Spine2D - AfterEffects workflow. I want to apologize for the quality of my painting, I'm not an illustrator myself hahaha
I learned a damn lot through the process, I may say this is the hardest animation I've made so far, but I still need to keep improving and learning. I hope I could have more time to polish this more.
Also, sorry for the huge amount of workarounds in this project ^^'

So now, here's the animation comparison between 3D and 2.5D using SFM!
The difference between the two styles are one of the following:
3D: A style where everything is made under third dimension and no 2D features.
2.5D: A Style where you make not only 3D, but to also mix it with 2D styles, along with making it work well with cel shaded styles to make it look like it's from the actual cartoon.

Merry Christmas! Today I explore How to integrate 2d hand drawn animation with 3d animation using a number of techniques and examples. This is an advanced skill involving multiple programs but it is very do-able. I advise you to first ask if it is necessary for you to merge the two mediums or if you can find a way to only use one. Because sticking to one medium can save a lot of time.

I've been a fan of the manga for years now, and was actually saving it for a ""top 10 manga"" type of thing- so I wasn't sure whether to be super hype or super disappointed about the announcement. I was both. Here's my scamboli review aka analysis on tengoku daimakyou.

So we made this concept video with our partners at Weta Workshop to show what a mixed reality could be.

In this video, I'll show you six options for combining different drawing mediums that I think are well worth you playing about with. 

--- MATERIALS I USED ---
Remember, you don't need the exact same materials or same brands as me, especially for quick sketches.

- Small set of 12 watercolour half pans, student quality, with standard colours. I use a Winsor & Newton travel set. I use this for the palette too.
- Small synthetic brush, round shape, number 6 size.
- Jar for water.
- Two black fine liner pens, waterproof ink. I use a Sakura Pigma Micron with a 03 and 05 nib. I use the larger nib when adding pastels and the smaller nib with watercolour.
- Set of pastel pencils. I use a set of 24 by Faber Castell (Pitt).
- Set of coloured pencils. I use a set of 24 by Faber Castell (Polychromos).
- A 2B graphite pencil.

What could this little notepad possibly offer that my phone doesn't? In this video, you'll find out how something so seemingly random and cheap can dramatically improve your life. 

How many times have you pulled out your phone to write something down, or look something up, turned on your phone, and instantly forgot what you were going to do? It happens all the time. If it's ever happened to you, you have been a result of amazing attention-grabbing engineers. That's ok, it's time to realize that some things your phone isn't as good at, but other things it is incredible. But once you realize this, your productivity will skyrocket.

Improve your photography compositions Instantly with these tips.
Improving your compositions is one of the most important steps to taking better Photos. With there being a bunch of rules out there, including the rule of thirds, the golden ratio, symmetry etc. it can quickly become overwhelming to learn about composition techniques. But, most of the concepts like leading lines, depth, balance, symmetry can all be explained with the rule of thirds. With new phones like the iPhone 15 pro max that has an optical zoom camera, there are more options for interesting compositions than ever before. Prime lenses or compact fixed-lens cameras like the Fujifilm X100V or Ricoh GRIII also offer an interesting challenge for finding creative compositions. These concepts work for improving your photography, cinematography, or even paintings, because a good composition is the basis of every good image.

I fell in love with analog/film photography and spent an entire year taking photos almost exclusively on film. But the inconsistent results I was getting and the price increases by Kodak and Fujifilm made me look for alternatives. That is why I spent the past months finding out how I can replicate the Film Look with digital cameras like the Fujifilm X-T30, Fujifilm X-Pro 1, Fujifilm GFX 50R, Sony A7RII, Sony A7IV, Nikon D2X. I have used all of these cameras to create images that have a nostalgic analog quality to them and today I am sharing my whole process and research on how you can do it too. One way is to use Fujifilm Film Simulations like the Portra 400 recipe by FujiXWeekly and another is the use of Lightroom Presets which I will both cover in this video, and even show you how you can edit your images to achieve this look yourself.

About me:
I've been making short films for 20 years, starting at age 11. I directed my first feature film, Bad is Bad, in 2010. Made for only $6,000, the film went on to reach over 7 million views and garner critical acclaim. More recently, my short film, Will ""The Machine"", screened and won awards at film festivals around the world. Released online in 2019, it reached over 1 million views in just a month. I also work as a video editor, cutting ads for clients such as Apple, Netflix, and Beats by Dre.

Hello friends! 
Welcome back and happy new year!  ï‡∏á‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î‡∏á Many of you have been asking me how I color grade my footage and videos, so I thought I would make a simple video for you to follow! I understand that many don't have access to laptops or pcs because they cost a leg. So, I made a color grading tutorial for all of you who are just starting out and have a phone or tablet in hand. Capcut is pretty widely known and is available on Android as well as IOS. 

I really hope this tutorial helped you in understanding color grading a little better and please do not hesitate to contact me on my socials if you are not sure about anything! Feedback is also always welcomed!

SECRETS TO ‚ú®PERFECT LINE-ART‚ú® | Beginner Line Art Tutorial #procreate #arttutorial,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQWNgPe5TM,artsytsaa,Film & Animation,[''],2023-11-15T02:28:50.537Z,"Hey Artlings! üßãhere‚Äôs my beginners lineart tutorial in which I teach you how to draw Perfect line art in procreate and any other program with streamline. I show you the secrets to do smooth clean lines and get rid of that chicken scratch and how to actually make your line art look like your sketch! While it can be as simple as using the classic line technique, there are a lot of things that can help you have the best lineart experience ever! These are all the things that I wish I knew when I was making manga style commissions and trying to get clean lines as a not so clean artist. As this is a  #beginnersarttutorial I will be going into some depth of some settings that might be, and while my lineart is technically not perfect, this information in the right hands (aka someone dedicated to line art) will definitely be able to make their lines perfect.

(Also sorry for the plosives in the first audio and the general audio levels, I'm still working on my recording skillz üôèü•≤)

Gouache presents at least five difficulties: it freezes, it dries fast, it reactivates, it looks chalky, and it shifts values when it dries. James Gurney faces each of these challenges, answering viewer questions as he paints Hudson River iceboats, and charts the properties of gouache, casein, and acrylic.

MIKE‚Äôs lyrical content on ‚ÄúDISCO!‚Äù seems to be centered around faith and family; MIKE dives into introspection multiple times on the album, giving listeners a look at the world from his own two eyes.

(^ My Thoughts: I personally find 'Light for Visual Artists' to be more on point for studying lighting, as a digital artist. 'Color and Light' was a fantastic book, but its focus on traditional painting techniques and usage of paintings as examples, can sometimes make it challenging for me to grasp its application on digital illustration.)

Hey streetling! You wanna learn how wealthy I am... as a billionaire!? I'll try to put it in ""poor people terms"" so that's you'll understand. I need like a visual aid. Oh I know, I'll use grains of rice! Now, how many grains of rice do you think I'll need to paint a picture of such magnificent wealth compared to the average house hold income? Well... Do you see that starch molecule right there, next to that singular grain of rice? You can't? Well that's because it represents the average American GPD of $65K ! That amount is so small it's negligible to me, barley noticeable... a molecule. Now compare your molecule to what represents my wealth. A WHOLE grain of rice, filled with millions of molecules!! This grain represents 23 Billions dollars, and oh yeah... I have TWO grains. Metaphorically of course! I don't eat rice. I don't eat at all. Oh... and I bought eyeballs that can see molecules. PEASANT!

She revealed off of the songs she can't wait for her fans to hear. She also refused to share her skin routine with Lechero & admitted she doesn't care if she rocks a fake bag & doesn't care if she's verified on IG. We also joked about her fans giving us a hard time. It's all love when she comes through. Enjoy!

We are excited to announce ""Kimini Muchuu"" music video to premiere on YouTube at 12am December 9.

Lead single ""Kimini Muchuu"" (main theme for TBS Friday night drama ""Saiai"") is out digitally on November 26.

One noteworthy mention of this latest track would be that A.G. Cook is credited again as producer, following his contribution to the earlier megahit this year ""One Last Kiss"" (theme song for ""EVANGELION:3.0+1.0 THRICE UPON A TIME""). Cook is the founder of the British record label PC Music and music producer known for his work with Charli XCX, among others. Be sure to check out another masterpiece from the great collab!

"Does Quadeca's ""I Didn't Mean to Haunt You"" Suck? Quadeca - IDMTHY Breakdown",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lB27pbve2A,Gatsb7,Entertainment,"['quadeca', 'quadeca i didnt mean to haunt you', 'idmthy', 'quadeca idmthy', 'sisyphus', 'born yesterday', 'knots', 'tell me a joke', 'fantano', 'anthony fantano', 'theneedledrop', 'gatsb7', 'quadeca album reaction', 'reaction', 'review', 'album review', 'album deep dive', 'quadeca reaction', 'quadeca i didnt mean to haunt you review', 'quadeca i didnt mean to haunt you reaction', 'reacting to quadeca', 'reacting to quadeca album']",2023-11-12T04:06:34.164Z,"THE ANSWER IS NO! 

WOW! Very impressed with this album. Quadeca really showed a lot of growth from his previous project (From me to You) on this project (I didn‚Äôt mean to haunt you) Evoking memories of Childish Gambino‚Äôs ‚ÄúAwaken, my Love‚Äù and Tyler, the Creator‚Äôs ‚ÄúIGOR‚Äù I didn‚Äôt mean to haunt you is a journey from top to bottom. While most songs left me feeling inspired and impressed, a few left me questioning decisions and feeling more overwhelmed than anything. 

Favorite songs: Knots, Fantasyworld, Born Yesterday
Least favorite song(s): Picking up Hands

It consists of two parts: a computer and a battery booster, which together ensure all-day battery life. The device offers live translation, calorie counting, and a perpetual power system, marking a significant advancement in wearable technology.

Key features include voice, touch, gesture interactions, and a laser ink display, without the need for wake words. It runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset, providing the necessary speed for AI functionalities. Unlike traditional apps, Humane's OS uses AI experiences, both on-device and cloud-based, to provide services on demand, such as playing music or providing web-sourced information.

The hardware includes an ultra-wide RGV camera, depth and motion sensors, and a unique speaker that creates a sound bubble. It ensures privacy and security with a dedicated privacy chip and a trust light indicator for sensor activity. The AI Pin can assist with messaging, summarizing important messages, and providing information like gate codes. It also helps track dietary goals, like protein intake.

The AI Pin supports real-world shopping, providing information and transaction options for products. It captures photos and videos, stores data, and offers recommendations based on user preferences. Managed through the Humane Dot Center, it promises a simplified interaction with data.

The device will be available with various accessories for customization and protection, including a charging case. Priced at $699, it includes additional services like unlimited queries, talk, text, and data for $24 a month. This innovative device raises the question of whether screenless smartphones could transform daily life, offering a blend of convenience and advanced technology.

Lyrics - 


[Intro: Timbaland]
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me?
East Coast, feel me, West Coast, feel me
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me?
East Coast, feel me, West Coast, feel me
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me?
East Coast, feel me, West Coast, feel me
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me?
East Coast, feel me, West Coast, feel me

[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
Boy, I've been watching you like the hawk in the sky
That flies, but you were my prey (My prey)
Boy, I promise you if we keep bumpin' heads
I know that one of these days (Days)
We gon' hook it up, prolly talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I've been holdin' back this secret from you
I probably shouldn't tell it

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
But if I, If I let you know
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no, 'cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?
[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
Boy, won't you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block, while everyone sleep, sleep, sleep
I'll be waiting there with my trench, my locs, my hat
Just so I'm lowkey, If you tell the world
(Don't speak, you know that would be weak)
Oh boy, see I'm trusting you with my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn't let you

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
But if I, If I let this go
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
I hope you're responsible
Boy, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no, 'cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody

[Verse 3: Timbaland & Aaliyah]
Baby girl, I'm the man from the big VA
Won't you come play round my way
And listen to what I gotta say
Timbaland (What) don't you know I am the man
Rock shows here to Japan
Have people shaking, shaking my hand
Baby girl, better known as Aaliyah
Give me goosebumps and high fevers
Makin' playa haters believers
Don'tcha know, gotta tell somebody, cause
'Cause I really need somebody (What?)
Tell me you're that somebody (What?)
[Chorus: Aaliyah]
If I let this go
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no, 'cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
I hope you're responsible
Boy, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no, 'cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm bout naughty naughty
'Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?

I am using FL Studio to try and do this, and this video will show my attempt from start to finish. I start by showing you the sample that he used, a quick look at how he did it, and how I am going to do things differently.

Hope you guys like the video! By the way, this video is a ‚Äúdramatization‚Äù, I actually already made the beat prior. I just wanted to figure out a way to show you guys how I did it in an entertaining way.

Billboard is reporting that the phone ‚Äî called the Light Phone II ‚Äî will drop on Thursday (November 2).The minimalist phone, done in partnership with the company Light, doesn‚Äôt have a web browser or a color interface, and is meant to be a more ‚Äúminimalist‚Äù response to the standard cell phone.

Making video games can be really tough. But thanks to cool game engines like Scratch, it's incredibly simple. It uses a high-level, visual scripting language to help teach kids and adults how to program. And honestly, it's perfect for people who are asking the question ""How to learn how to program?"" or ""How to make video games"". And after my last programming video using C++, let's see just how easy Scratch MIT is to use.

Unity made a lot of poor choices lately, especially with its install fee that made me, and a lot of game developers, question if they should stick with Unity or switch to a different engine.
This video is not supposed to be a ""should YOU switch to Unreal"" type of video, it's just why I'M switching to Unreal.

Two companies are currently racing to revolutionize how you access the internet. You saw the title, we‚Äôre talking about Arc & Sigma OS.
How are they different? Which one is better and which one should you use? We‚Äôll answer all of that in this video.

Arc and Sigma OS are two platforms that boast an array of features designed to streamline, enhance, and simplify online tasks.

Arc is a polished, intuitive platform that supports multitasking with features like a smart screenshot system, the ability to create live captures within an 'Easel' (a private whiteboard for saving ideas, files, images, texts, and more), and a split-screen function allowing up to four tabs to be viewed at once. The platform is organized by a sidebar with pinned favorite sites and grouped tabs. It provides multiple 'spaces' for different tasks like work, personal items, and social media. One can customize the look of websites via the 'Boosts' feature and conduct versatile searches using the 'Spotlight' search bar that can open new tabs, pin a tab, and more.

Sigma OS, like Arc, features a robust search tool called 'Lazy Search'. It can be used to navigate through every setting and shortcut, find tabs, search history, navigate to a new workspace, and even create new items in specific apps. Sigma OS organizes items into workspaces that house tabs, almost functioning like a to-do list. Tabs can be marked as 'done', locked, renamed, tagged, or snoozed. Sigma OS also supports split screens and has extensive keyboard shortcuts. It uses different profiles for different workspaces and facilitates collaboration by inviting others to shared workspaces. An AI companion, Airis, can summarize articles, provide explanations, translations, or even rewrite text in a simplified way.

üéπ Is This Book the Key to Anime & J-POP Music? https://youtu.be/cFFfQk9gM2o

It turns out that Relative Multipolar Tonality, an idea outlined by Kayano Chino in the book Japanese Music Harmony, is not that unusual a harmonic technique. We look at a handful of American and British pop songs that all use a mixture of chords from the major key and its relative minor.

Songs included:
Such Great Heights by The Postal Service
Cryin' by Aerosmith
Don't Look Back in Anger by Oasis
I Want To Hold Your Hand by The Beatles
Creep by Radiohead
Steven Universe Opening by Rebecca Sugar

"""Apple's 8GB RAM on M3 MacBook Pro is Analogous to 16GB on PCs""",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PK9RzSl9O0,NikTek,Entertainment,"['niktek', 'gaming', 'pc', 'pc masterrace', 'rtx', 'radeon', 'gpu', 'gaming gpu', 'entertaining', 'pc memes', 'tech memes', 'linus tech tips', 'ltt', 'funny content', 'informative content', 'informative memes', 'pcmr', 'macbook pro', 'apple', 'max tech']",2023-11-11T14:52:15.581Z,"An Apple employee has recently made a comment on the lack of Memory on MacBook Pro, he said in an interview that ""8GB RAM on M3 MacBook Pro is Analogous to 16GB on PCs"". Yet he failed to mention the fact that it is easy for apple to make 16GB MacBook Pros because it costs Apple only 34$ to produce, in this video I show you different results that prove that MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM is not in fact faster than having the same 16GB MacBook Pro, let alone compare it to the power of PCs. With how much Apple charges you for an extra 8GB RAM upgrade, you can buy 32GB RAM sticks on PC and Windows Laptops.

Rhythm Roulette: Parker Corey (of Injury Reserve) | Mass Appeal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlBhxlwj7tk,Mass Appeal,Entertainment,"['mass appeal', 'hip hop', 'skate', 'decon', 'skateboarding', 'nyc', 'new york', 'music', 'graffiti', 'rhythm roulette', 'mass appeal rhythm roulette', 'rhythm roulette mass appeal', 'parker corey rhythm roulette', 'rhythm roulette parker corey', 'injury reserve rhythm roulette', 'rhythm roulette injury reserve', 'mass appeal parker corey', 'parker corey mass appeal', 'injury reserve mass appeal', 'mass appeal injury reserve', 'injury reserve', 'parker corey']",2023-11-11T05:20:22.106Z,"The Arizona rap trio Injury Reserve put Tempe on the map with a series of eclectic releases ranging from 'Live from the Dentist Office' to, most recently, 'Drive It Like It's Stolen.' Throughout their catalog, beatmaking duties were handled by producer Parker Corey, who's proven himself to be a master of multiple styles.

For the latest edition of MASS APPEAL's Rhythm Roulette, Corey pulled up to Poo Bah Records in Pasadena California, accompanied by Ritchie With a T (Stepa J. Groggs apparently had other pressing business to attend to). In accordance with the time-honored Rhythm Roulette ground rules, PC tied a bandana over his eyes and selected three records at random, then headed back to the lab to see what sort of a beat he could fashion from his vinyl haul.

""First off we got Minister Keith Pringle and the Pentecostal Community Choir-looks like the most potential right now,"" said Corey, surveying the sampling options at hand. Next up was something called 'Compilation Menu,' which presented tracks by various artists in restaurant menu format, and finally 'Mythical Kings and Iguanas' by the American songwriter and poet Dory Previn. ""This shit is really about iguanas!"" Parker exclaimed with enthusiasm. ""Yeah-we're gonna do it!""

Slouched on a nearby couch, Ritchie With A T looked up from his phone and predicted, ominously, that  ""One of these is going to be like, a classic album, and we're just gonna get grilled for it!""

Undeterred by Ritchie's warning, Parker plunged right into the random collection of sounds, laboring over his laptop for hours until Stepa J. Groggs showed up and Ritchie began dancing. Check out the latest episode of Rhythm Roulette to watch Corey in the kitchen and see what sort of heat he cooked up.

The amount of respect I have for Tyler is insane and THIS VIDEO is just a small reminder for me as a Creative Person and even Artist.

He was giving advice on Starting A Brand or making something, and he is just giving all of these for free man.

I will definitely make another video for Tyler's Advice on Starting A Brand

Thank you for watching this video, I hope this is also a source for reminders, creativity, and even inspiration for yourself.

Like bro, this guy's influence and creativity are just crazy. It's like when you hear Tyler, The Creator, you know how cool this guy really is. When your friend group listens to Tyler you know they are just fucking cool man.

But honestly, I am trying to start my own Brand/ Clothing line and Tyler's advice is really just reminders and motivation for you to just push and pursue and to do whatever you want because life is just so short man fr. 

Thank you for watching.

What is Standard Story Company?
I'm Kent Lamm, an independent filmmaker living in Los Angeles. My goal with this channel is to help other filmmakers improve the storytelling in their films, and to be a home for my own work.

I've been making short films for 20 years, starting at age 11. I directed my first feature film, Bad is Bad, in 2010. Made for only $6,000, the film went on to reach over 7 million views and garner critical acclaim. More recently, my short film, Will ""The Machine"", screened and won awards at film festivals around the world. Released online in 2019, it reached over 1 million views in just a month. I also work as an editor, cutting videos for clients such as Apple, Netflix, and Beats by Dre.

This week we dive into Addy's Valley as we introduce a cast of quirky frogs to liven up the game environment. But these aren't ordinary frogs, they're Jabos. Don't get it twisted. Follow the transformation from a basic Blender model to a lively Unity animation, complete with walking, idle, and struggling movements. Despite the amateur UV mapping and modeling, witness the application of wet surface shaders and inverse kinematics to give Jabo a lifelike presence in a digital world.

Game-changing updates to our Chinese and Japanese courses - Improving how we teach Asian languages,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZQ2zK2aROo,Duolingo,Education,"['learn japanese', 'learn chinese', 'asian languages', 'duolingo']",2023-11-10T20:31:25.857Z,"Character-based languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean use visual symbols to represent whole words rather than spelling out words with letters in languages like you may see in the English language. That means that how Duolingo teaches these languages is different from languages using the Roman alphabet. Why is this important? For starters, billions of people speak these languages already! But as Haina will explain, there's been more interest than ever in learning Asian languages thanks in part to pop culture, food trends, social media, and more. After that, Celena will share exciting updates live now and coming soon in our Chinese and Japanese courses. - - - Presented as part of Duolingo Duocon 2023, a free global event at the intersection of language, learning, and technology: https://www.duolingo.com/duocon

The Lessons:
- You don't have to have an unhealthy relationship with social media
- Drop comparisons, valuable creative work is a practice, not an outcome
- Focus on preparation & learning, this will guarantee long-term growth
- Cultivate an open mind & question your preconceptions, rigid thinking will limit your work
- Giving space for physical & mental wellbeing, is a force multiplier over time
- Try not to resist change, it's normal for people to make moves
- Embrace flexibility in your path, for most people the creative journey is long

I'm unboxing the top dog of Legion Laptops. The Lenovo Legion Pro 9i is the finest laptop in the legion line-up that Lenovo has to offer, and it does NOT disappoint.

I love the carbon fiber top-cover, slim build, and it's even lighter than I expected. For around $3,200 this is one of the BEST bang-for-buck laptops money can buy. It has the styling and build quality of a laptop twice its price.

00:26 - Excitement about unboxing and benchmarking the laptop.
00:51 - Comparisons with the Strix Scar 17 and anticipation for the unboxing.

06:05 - Comparing the Legion Pro 9i with previous Legion models.
06:31 - Overview of ports and connections on the laptop.
07:00 - Testing the hinge, flicking it open, and revealing the trackpad.
07:18 - Expressing concern about the small size of the trackpad.
07:38 - Comparing the trackpad size with the Legion Pro 7i.
08:05 - Observations on the laptop's display, RGB lighting, and aesthetic.

09:02 - Appreciation for the 3K display and matte finish.
09:31 - Introduction to the Lenovo Vantage center and available settings.
10:01 - Discussing rounded edges and thin bezels of the laptop.
10:30 - Noticing the RGB lighting on the back of the laptop.

Social media can easily wreck your artistic growth if you chase the algorithm and allow it to dictate which art you do and don't make. Creative risks and experimentation are essential components of long term success as an artist, but risk taking isn't incentivized by most platforms, especially if you're already doing well.

Jordan Ward: Tiny Desk Concert,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcINbc0ye-o,NPR Music,Music,"['NPR', 'NPR Music', 'National Public Radio', 'Live', 'Performance', 'tiny desk', 'tiny desk concert', 'tony desk', 'tiny concert']",2023-11-10T16:39:46.848Z,"Ashley Pointer | October 23, 2023
Jordan Ward showed up to NPR headquarters radiating with a warm energy that felt familiar, like linking up with your favorite cousin at the cookout. After all, the immense amount of creativity and synergy displayed by Ward and his bandmates during this Tiny Desk performance is indicative of pure fellowship.

The St. Louis bred singer-songwriter started his professional career as a backup dancer for stars like Justin Bieber and Becky G. Since carving out his lane in music, Ward has been steadily on the rise and dropped his stellar debut album, FORWARD earlier this year. He's an effervescent presence in R&B and this Tiny Desk concert traverses an array of his most beloved musical moments, directed by producer Lido on vintage synths and backed by PG county's own Alex Vaughn on vocals.

Ward opened his six song set with a dreamy soundscape before diving into his 2021 song ""Lil Baby Crush."" And when Lido cued the unmistakable synth lines from ""WHITE CROCS,"" they turned up the energy in a Tiny Desk arrangement of the already classic tune. Closing out the show on a sweet note, Ward serenaded the audience with a bossa nova-infused arrangement of ""CHERIMOYA,"" and you can't help but wonder how so much talent can exist in one person.

Noname: Tiny Desk Concert,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtCB7vy1q2E,NPR Music,Music,"['NPR', 'NPR Music', 'National Public Radio', 'Live', 'Performance', 'tiny desk', 'tiny desk concert', 'tony desk', 'tiny concert']",2023-11-10T16:38:47.395Z,"Ashley Pointer | November 10, 2023
Out of the thousand and some Tiny Desk concerts to date, it‚Äôs seldom an artist returns to the Desk. But when they do, there are a couple requirements: come in a new iteration or present something completely different. In this case, the Chicago-bred, emcee-activist Noname does both when she performs some revolutionary raps from her third album, Sundial, and premieres an unreleased single from hip-hop trio Ghetto Sage, made up of her and frequent collaborators, Smino and Saba. 

A lot has changed since Fatimah Warner dropped her classic debut, Telefone, in 2016 and made her first appearance behind the Tiny Desk in 2017. She released a stunning follow-up, Room 25, and she even briefly paused her music career to delve deep into her work as an activist. However, holding a mirror up to herself, her community and the music industry is a signature that persists across her career, and even more so on her album Sundial. 

Complemented by her dynamic six-piece band, she performs a few selects from this album including the gospel-infused ‚ÄúHold Me Down,‚Äù which Noname describes perfectly as ‚Äúa petty love letter to my community.‚Äù Then she gets into ‚ÄúBoomboom‚Äù featuring the vocalist Ayoni, who delivers a raw and powerful performance. She then invites Smino and Saba up to perform the unreleased ‚ÄúKush and Love Songs,‚Äù delivering clever and conscious bars on top of a swing groove. Concluding the show in true Noname fashion with ‚ÄúBalloons,‚Äù she asks the audience: ‚ÄúWhere better to do my most controversial song than NPR? Real journalism.‚Äù

It's been a big, weird, scary and exciting year for me and it's time to start unpacking it all. This is the video I tried to finish before I left town almost exactly 6 months ago, but it's come full circle now in a way that ended up making a better video as a whole. 

Go pick up a camera, or an old camcorder, or heck even your phone, and hit record. As long as you do it for you‚Äîand future you‚Äîto enjoy, that's really all that matters. Cheers, and more videos to come"

Cracking Contraptions full series compilation. Wallace invents an array of contraptions to try and make life easier but it's always Gromit who picks up the pieces.

Wallace and Gromit first arrived on our screens in Nick Park‚Äôs Academy Award¬Æ-winning ‚ÄúA Grand Day Out‚Äù and went on to star in three further 30-minute classics; ‚ÄúThe Wrong Trousers‚Äù, ‚ÄúA Close Shave‚Äù and ‚ÄúA Matter of Loaf or Death‚Äù and a feature length film ‚ÄúThe Curse of the Were-Rabbit‚Äù . Wallace and Gromit are internationally celebrated winning over 100 awards at festivals - including 3 Academy Awards¬Æ and 5 BAFTA¬Æ Awards.

‚ÄúWallace & Gromit: A Matter of Loaf or Death‚Äù remains the most watched Christmas Day programme since 2008 when it premiered on BBC One. The duo have been featured in their first augmented reality story ‚ÄòThe Big Fix Up‚Äô which launched in 2021. They have their own permanent attraction at Blackpool Pleasure Beach and their charity, Wallace & Gromit's Children's Charity, has raised over ¬£50million since 1995.

We are now thrilled to announce that Nick Park‚Äôs iconic duo are returning for a new film in 2024!

Welcome to the official Shaun the Sheep Global (English) YouTube channel - home to Shaun, Timmy, the Flock, Bitzer, the Farmer and their friends! üêëüêïüë®‚Äçüåæ

Shaun is a sheep who doesn't follow the flock - in fact, he leads them into all sorts of scrapes and scraps, turning peace in the valley into mayhem in the meadow. Shaun and his pals run rings around their poor sheepdog Bitzer, as he tries to stop the Farmer finding out what's going on behind his back. Every day brings a new adventure for Shaun! Shaun the Sheep made his very first appearance on screens in the Wallace and Gromit film, 'A Close Shave'.

I used to be a very quiet speaker, but that was one of the core reasons why I didn't shine, because I had goodness in me that no one could see, hear or feel. It made me invisible.

The first step that I believe you should take if you're looking to improve your communication skills is to learn how to use volume in your speech, which brings life to your words.

This exercise helped me MASSIVELY to become more aware of how loud I was speaking.

Rhythm Roulette: DJ Dahi (Serato Edition) | Mass Appeal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2HifS0TMHY,Mass Appeal,Entertainment,"['mass appeal', 'hip hop', 'skate', 'decon', 'skateboarding', 'nyc', 'new york', 'music', 'graffiti', 'dj dahi mass appeal', 'dj dahi', 'mass appeal dj dahi', 'dj dahi rhythm roulette mass appeal', 'dj dahi rhythm roulette', 'rhythm roulette dj dahi', 'rhythm roulette mass appeal', 'mass appeal rhythm roulette', 'rhythm roulette']",2023-11-09T19:30:05.690Z,"For more information about Serato Sample, visit: https://serato.com/sample

DJ Dahi does his thing on another level, crafting beats for such giants as Drake, Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West and Dr. Dre. So it's appropriate that Dahi's second appearance on Rhythm Roulette be anything but ordinary. This time around we made two important innovations to our standard operating procedure.

First of all, instead of a regular old record store, the Grammy-nominated Los Angeles-based producer came out to NYC and went digging through cardboard boxes in the back of a van stuffed full of treats by rare groove vendor Gene Brown. In case you were unaware, Brown is a North Carolina-based MC/producer who specializes in serving up sample fodder to production gods like Pete Rock and the aforementioned Mr. West. Digging in his crates is like looking for gold at Fort Knox.

In this case Dahi slipped on a blindfold and came up with a gospel record by the Midwestern District Choir, Greg Perry's 1977 funk/soul classic Smokin', and what Mr. Brown described as an ""extremely rare Brazilian joint.""

""Let's go make some beats!"" said Dahi, clutching the vinyl in his hands.

This second major advantage in this action-packed episode is that Dahi got the chance to work with a brand new Serato software plug-in called Sample that integrates with Serato's O.G. production software, Pitch 'n Time. As the name suggests, Sample allows users to chop samples and manipulate them freely.  BPMs can be adjusted to the utmost extreme without any loss of audio quality. A highly intuitive interface allowed Dahi to quickly find, chop, key-shift, and time-stretch samples.

""There's some really dope features,"" said Dahi. ""We're just going to experiment and try to find  some cool stuff and see if we can come up with some gems."" Check out the fruits of his labor in the video up top.

Something that you might notice in these progressions is that they are quite simple and there's the underlying theme of 1) the progressions start on either IV, I, or vi, and 2) the movement is very stepwise instead of the traditional pop leaps going in 3rds / 6ths and 4ths / 5ths. Makes for some great simple movement and emotional tension!

lyrics:

[Intro: Ariana Grande]
Woo!
Woo!
Uh
Uh

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Seven billion people
Tryna free themselves
Said a billion prayers
Tryna save myself
I can see it coming
But it's moving fast

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
Been thru a hurricane
With the sunroof down
Dancing with no pain
Wait to see the sunrise
It's a holiday (Hey)
When you're around (When‚Åüyou're‚Åüaround)
Breath‚Åüof fresh air,‚Åület the cold‚Åüwinter breeze in
I can feel it slow down, oh

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams
Maybe this whole world ain't exactly what it seems
Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow
But one thing's for certain, baby
We're running out of time
Oh, time, time, Oh

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Running after something
But I don't know what
Where am I running to?
Too afraid to stop
Hundred miles an hour
With no seat belt on
Time is everlasting
I can't wait that long (Ooh)

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams
Maybe this whole world ain't exactly what it seems
Maybe the sky will fall down on tomorrow
But one thing's for certain, baby
We're running out of time

[Verse 4: Ariana Grande]
My feet are falling to the bottom of the ocean
Running out of time, out of time, yeah
High on emotion, I can feel it moving forward
Running out of time, running out
Running out, running out of time

[Chorus: Choir]
And maybe all the stars in the night are really dreams
Maybe this whole world ain't exactly what it seems
Maybe the skies will fall down on tomorrow
But one thing's for certain, baby
We're running out of time

[Bridge: Childish Gambino + Choir]
Time
Time (Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
It's about power
Time
It‚Äôs always bout power
Time
Oh I‚Äôm in time
I'm just tryna feel it
Time
Get a little bit stronger
Gotta go all out
A nigga gon ball out
Try to not fall out
Tryna be better
Gotta get better
To many pressure
A nigga need pressure
people need pressure


[Outro: Choir]
Running out of time, we're running
Running out of time, we're running
Running out of time, we're running

The Unifics-Dawn Of A New Day,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwn6q4Xy_sU,Lilforyou ,Music,"['Al Johnson', 'The Unifics']",2023-11-09T01:39:27.935Z,"The Unifics were an American soul group from Washington, D.C.. In 1966 a group of talented students at Washington D.C.'s Howard University in 1966 formed the upstart group Al & the Vikings. Consisting of singer/songwriter Al Johnson, Tom Fauntleroy, Marvin Brown, Bob Hayes, and George Roland, the group changed its name during its first year to the Unique Five and later to the Unifics. Known for their smooth harmonies and their dapper attire, the Unifics soon gathered a large following in the D.C. area and began to attract attention elsewhere.  I Do Not Own the rights to this song.

""Kirk was a major exponent of circular breathing. Using this technique, he was not only able to sustain a single note for an extended period; he could also play sixteenth-note runs of almost unlimited length, and at high speeds. His circular breathing ability enabled him to record ""Concerto for Saxophone"" on the Prepare Thyself to Deal with a Miracle LP in one continuous take of about 20 minutes' playing with no discernible ""break"" for inhaling.""

Recorded in 1973, this is yet another criminally underappreciated Rahsaan Roland Kirk recording from the last phase of a remarkable career. This is perhaps Kirk's most experimental recording in that it involves his most involved performing on multiple horns and flutes -- including his infamous and wonderful nose flute -- and working with drones on a more surface level. Given Kirk's system of playing three horns at once, the drone horn was always a part of his sonic architecture. The difference here is that the melodic and improvisational lines take a back seat on tunes such as the opening ""Salvation and Reminiscing,"" where he makes fantastic use of a baby E-flat saxophone, and on ""Celestial Bliss,"" on which he is accompanied on his ""black mystery pipes"" only by percussion. On the medley ""Seasons: One Mind Winter/Summer/Ninth Ghost,"" Kirk begins with the nose flutes, playing a part of ""Balm in Gilead,"" before bringing in a six-piece string orchestra to play behind him as he improvises on all the melodies and modes. And this improvisation is not just a series of out arpeggios playing legato and running through and over the changes, but intricately nuanced, gentle, and architecturally sophisticated wanderings. Despite the beauty of the album's first three tracks, it is on the closer, the 21-and-a-half-minute ""Saxophone Concerto,"" where Kirk most leaves his mark as a composer and innovator on the jazz world. Kirk comes out blowing literally like a train and weaves in, with vocalists Jeanne Lee and Dee Dee Bridgewater, a series of muted horn lines and rhythm figures. The band is 16 pieces total, and the concerto is structured in movements from an intro in which the purpose is stated: ""time for America to discover some of its true Black miracles,"" wherein bebop and hard bop shimmy up against free modes and articulations by the rhythm section and the other horns. Kirk may solo on top with his tenor, but he holds close to the rhythm section's articulation of mutated blues. From here, Latin and faux classical chromatics are shaded into the whole as the pace becomes more and more frenetic, and just as the piece becomes perhaps circus-like, Kirk and company strip it all back and out, into a free universe washed by improvising vocalists, crashing cymbals, droning brass, and rumbling tom-toms before it's all a hush of unidentifiable sounds except for those of breaking glass. There are numerous metaphors and metonyms here, but they will not come to the listener until later, when she or he regains the conscious notion of breathing."

"""A Trip To Heaven"" (1968) Wondering Souls of N. C.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18W34OY8uww,Gospel Nostalgia,Music,[''],2023-11-09T01:32:58.436Z,"This is track 7 from the 1968 album ""The Work Of the Lord"".
Lead by Harold Williamson
The Wondering Souls are: Harold Williamson, Roosevelt Gardner, Robert Ederington, Bobby Rogers, Chris Clemons, Carl Clemons, Leroy Rogers, Dean Williamson, Anthony McNeil and Gene Williamson.
The group was formed in 1954 and made their recording debut as the Wandering Souls on the Gospel and Regent label in 1963. In 1967,  they released their first album, God Is Near, on the Gospel label, shortly followed by Revival Time and The Work Of The Lord on Rae-Cox. Harold Williamson and his fellow Wandering and Wondering souls from Shelby had to wait almost a decade before they released another album; Let Your Light Shine on the TCS label from Philadelphia. Their next release was , The Ground Is Level At The Foot Of The Cross, on Rae-Cox. The core of the group from day one till the end was Harold Williamson (first lead), Robert Ederington (baritone and tenor) and Roosevelt Gardner (lead and tenor). 
They made their recoding debut in 1962 with an EP on T.W.S. as the Wandering Souls of Dayton, Ohio, which was an unusual format for Gospel music. Not for our Wondering and Wandering Souls from Dayton, Ohio, because in 1973 they released another EP. This time on Designer. In 1978 and 1980 they made albums for Rejoice out of Cincinnati, Ohio as the Wondering Souls. Those albums were God Is watching and Train Of Love. Members of the group through the years for longer and shorter periods were: Morris Anderson (lead vocals), Rev. Henry Philpot (lead vocals), Willie Ballard (vocals), Jimmy Wright (vocals), Ronnie Heard (vocals, guitars), Bobby Rogers (vocals), Robert Tolliver Jr (vocals, bass guitar), James Marks (drums, percussion), Leon Neal (vocals, guitars), Ronald Nooks (vocals, keyboards) and Calvin Lark (vocals)."

Lyrics:
Intro: 
Fra-fractions of infinity

Verse 1
When‚Äôs the last time you let yourself think?
I might be gone every time I let myself blink
I wouldn‚Äôt say I was surprised
On the 82nd time
When‚Äôs the last time your love was unrequited? 
I know I showed up to the party uninvited
It‚Äôs getting hard for me to hide (show me how you‚Äôll sentence me)
Running out the light (divided divinity)

Chorus:
Tell me,
You think it‚Äôs all in your head
You might be already dead
It‚Äôs funny when you think about it all again

Verse 2:
Been afraid of nothing for so long
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm stuck with it
But nothing is gonna change
Until I change what nothing is 
And it‚Äôs‚Ä¶
Fractions of infinity
Fractions of infinity
Show me how you‚Äôll sentence me
Divided divinity

Chorus 2:
Tell me,
You think it‚Äôs all in your head
You might be already dead
It‚Äôs funny when you think about it all again‚Ä¶

Bridge verse:
Every time I miss you,
I hear a voice without a face
And every time I‚Äôm with you,
The clock hands wave me out of place
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice
I see my life inside your hands
Walls cave in when you start to pray
I‚Äôve seen all I‚Äôll ever understand
Wouldn‚Äôt make sense in another way
I think I hit my target weight,
got exorcized (exercise) while I stood in place
Got every time that I couldn‚Äôt trace
Got restless eyes, they don‚Äôt look away
It emphasized that I shouldn‚Äôt stay, okay okay
Based on what?
Rippin up projector screens, the director screamin cut
Based on what?
Take 23 let‚Äôs get this scene and then it‚Äôll be enough
Right?
Throw some grain on if you can and that is that
I‚Äôm in that space between your hands about to clap,
Those walls are caving in and they say congratulations that‚Äôs a wrap.

Chorus 3:
Tell me,
You think it‚Äôs all in your head
You might be already dead
It‚Äôs funny when you think about it all again‚Ä¶


Outro:
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice 
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice

Those words don‚Äôt do you justice 
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice
(fractions of infinity)
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice 
(show me how you‚Äôll sentence me)"

Big Boi and JID Meet For Rolling Stone's Musicians on Musicians,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwC7N0VyV5o,Rolling Stone,Entertainment,"['big boi interview', 'j.i.d.', 'j.i.d. interview']",2023-11-08T16:30:24.042Z,"Atlanta's storied Stankonia Studios feel like the site of a family reunion as J.I.D walks in with a grin and daps up Big Boi with Stevie Wonder‚Äôs ‚ÄúAs‚Äù spilling from the speakers. Both are soft-spoken, and you can barely hear what they say to each other as they exchange greetings. But it‚Äôs a safe guess that they‚Äôre taking a moment to show respect for each other‚Äôs approach to life and their shared craft.

Fifty years after hip-hop began in the Bronx, both of these Atlanta rappers have done their part to expand the definition of the genre. Start in 1994, when Big Boi and Andr√© 3000 created a bible for Southern hip-hop with Outkast‚Äôs Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, written in the basement studio they called the Dungeon and recorded right here. Or flash forward to last year, when J.I.D recorded parts of his most recent, and most personal, offering, The Forever Story, in these same studios. Big Boi helped establish that Atlanta can never be left out of the conversation, and J.I.D has helped maintain the standard he set.

With the cameras on and lights up, they settle into a languid Southern rhythm. Much like their rhymes, their conversation feels like a late-summer evening full of lightning ‚Äî bright flashes that illuminate everything in sight, unpredictable yet direct. Big Boi, 48, cracks a joke that sends J.I.D, 33, into a fit of laughter. J.I.D fires something back that brings a large smile to Big Boi‚Äôs face.

Big Boi reminds us that this isn‚Äôt the first time Rolling Stone has asked him to take part in Musicians on Musicians ‚Äî it‚Äôs just the first time he had someone in mind who he wanted to sit down with. This time, when the ask came in, he knew. He snaps his fingers as he recalls how he replied: ‚ÄúI told them, ‚ÄòGet me my dawg, man.‚Äô‚Äù
