7:01 iPad as Phone Experience
9:26 iPad as Computer Experience
11:28 What Does it Better?
12:25 Conclusion

We have a 5G model of the iPad mini 6. This ipad is pretty expensive, and is slightly more expensive than the iphone 13 mini that apple still sells, but you get some benefits like a much larger screen, a usb type c port, and a fingerprint sensor. However, there are also trade offs, less cameras and lower camera quality, no wireless charging, no Face ID, no portable form factor, and no OLED display. The reason we need the 5G variant of the ipad mini is because this is what allows us to get connected to the internet no matter where you are, just like your smartphone. However, just like your smartphone, you need a data plan for the ipad. This can, however, vary by carrier and you may have to have just a tablet data plan instead. Now that we have that setup, we need to be able to make calls and message people. We‚Äôll assume you don‚Äôt have a phone, just this ipad. If that‚Äôs the case then we need a way to make phone calls and send messages. We need a VOIP. A VOIP  is a phone that uses the internet as the phone connection instead of a traditional phone line. To make things easy I went with Google Voice. Google Voice lets you freely create a VOIP phone number, but you need to also verify you‚Äôre legit by using a different phone number at setup, so they know you‚Äôre not a spam bot abusing their services. From there, everything is easy. Google voice behaves just like your phone. You can dial phone numbers, save contacts, send messages, receive notifications and you even have a voicemail for your favorite extended warranty person to use. 

Now, to replace a laptop, I obviously needed a mouse and keyboard. I‚Äôm using a standard apple case, and slapped a small Bluetooth keyboard and mouse to it. IPad OS already has a bunch of nice features that lets an iPad behave similar to a laptop. You can plug in external displays, use a usb hub and plug in multiple devices, you can move files between different storage devices, have multiple windows open side to side, on the screen, and use mice and keyboards. But basically because of the size, we won‚Äôt ever be using the iPad mini in our lap, only at desks.

As a phone, it actually fits in my front pocket but it‚Äôs not comfortable. Portability of this device is really not great as a phone. But functionally, It works fine as a phone but you have to get used to a few things. Calls are technically always on speaker, since the iPad mini doesn‚Äôt have an earpiece, so if you want some privacy you‚Äôll want to keep bluetooth earbuds or airpods with you, and some services you sign up for with your number think Google Voice numbers are bots and won‚Äôt let you use that google voice number to sign up for services or be used as an 2-factor authenticated number, which is a huge bummer since you‚Äôre giving up some security functionality. Also, there‚Äôs really no customer support if things don‚Äôt work well on Google Voice, it doesn‚Äôt seem like a huge Google priority. While there are a ton of ipad optimized apps, there are also a lot of apps that only made for iphones, and using those aren‚Äôt the greatest experience on such a large screen. 

Using it to casually surf the internet and do basic things like email, watching videos and editing documents is ok. But the screen is absolutely tiny for these types of tasks. It‚Äôs really hard to find a good angle to use it, unless it‚Äôs far away from you, or you connect it to an external monitor. And you can forget about comfortably using it on your lap. Even with a keyboard embedded case. So it‚Äôs really really bad as a laptop, but it does make an okay desktop since you can plug it in. The monitor only mirrors what‚Äôs already on the ipad screen. This does help with seeing what you draw using the apple pencil on a much larger display though. If the ipad mini gets one of those M chips, I can see people using the ipad mini decently as a makeshift desktop for basic computing but it would still be an awful laptop replacement. Also, the 64GB default for the mini is usable but not the best option when it‚Äôs used solely as a tablet, but while trying to do the job of 3 different devices, the 256GB model makes more sense, because you will run out of space on the 64GB model real quick."

Too many distractions? Are you full of excuses? We are all guilty. Seems like the perfect moment to listen to Cavalcade on vinyl.

Cavalcade is the second studio album by English rock band Black Midi. It was released on 28 May 2021, through Rough Trade Records. The album was primarily recorded in the summer of 2020 with producer John ""Spud"" Murphy, with the exception of the song ""John L"", which was recorded beforehand with Marta Salogni.

For Cavalcade, the band had a more premeditated approach to the writing and recording, as opposed to the improvisational approach taken for their debut studio album, Schlagenheim (2019). The opening track ""John L"" was released as a single in promotion of the album, followed by a louder mix of the fourth track ""Slow"", and finally ""Chondromalacia Patella"" before its release. The album received widespread acclaim, with critics complimenting the band's stylistic progression and composition.

In Japan, the focus is often on harmony with nature, minimalism, and multi-functionality. Rooms may serve dual purposes, with movable partitions like ""fusuma"" and ""shoji"" screens allowing for flexible use of space. Traditional elements like tatami mats, low wooden tables, and futons that can be folded away contribute to the minimalist aesthetic. In contrast, traditional American homes often aim for permanence and individuality, with fixed walls, large furniture, and dedicated rooms for specific functions like dining or watching TV.

Overall, traditional Japanese and American home designs serve as fascinating reflections of their respective cultures, demonstrating how architecture can be deeply tied to a society's values and lifestyle."

Phil Hanley began standup comedy by performing at open mics around Vancouver, often in between bands at music venues.  In these establishments he discovered and honed his unique blending of material and crowd interaction that makes no two of his performances the same. Phil‚Äôs style can best be described as unpredictably reflective, delivered with sharp accuracy, and rooted in the grand tradition of joke-telling.

Phil's Comedy Central ""The Half Hour"" premiered November 14, 2015.  Phil has previously been seen on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Late Night with Seth Meyers, The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson, The Pete Holmes Show, John Oliver‚Äôs New York Stand-Up Show, and @midnight. He has been showcased at numerous comedy festivals and can be seen regularly at The Comedy Cellar in New York City.

I'm currently 5 weeks out from my bodybuilding competition and we're currently estimating to be around 6% body fat right now and even though I look good, I feel far from it. 

I feel like people don't really talk about the negatives all too often when it comes to prepping for a bodybuilding competition naturally and boy is there a lot of negatives. I honestly don't really advocate for anyone to compete unless you're crazy but I'll make a video about that in the future. But anyways, here's what you can expect hehe 

üëâüèº No physical and mental capacity to do ANYTHING
üëâüèº Bad mood all the time
üëâüèº You feel like you're just existing day by day
üëâüèº Water goes right through you so you just pee all the time
üëâüèº Extremely poor sleep quality 
üëâüèº Hungry all the time and you're never full or satiated 
üëâüèº Training doesn't feel good - you get 0 pump 
üëâüèº You're always cold 
üëâüèº You're always sad 
üëâüèº You have no libido 
üëâüèº You get more boys

On a more positive note though, @theomnideskau just released their new ergonomic chairs, so you should go get one using my code ""LEE"" hehe xo

Take $50 off your desk order üëáüèº
@theomnideskau - DISCOUNT CODE: ""LEE"" 

Look as cute as me üëáüèº

#jessicakirson 










Jessica Kirson is a powerhouse on stage. She‚Äôs a hilariously relatable performer of sheer silliness, vulnerability, and ridiculous characters. Her countless comedic character videos have racked up over 50 million views on social media. Her audience is multigenerational, creating an excuse for large groups of friends and families to spend a night out together. In an era where only 10% of all touring comedians are female, Jessica stands out as one of the strongest comedians regardless of gender.

Jessica produced FX‚Äôs Hysterical, a feature-length documentary that premiered at SXSW 2021. The film explores the changing landscape of women in stand-up comedy and features Margaret Cho, Nikki Glazer, Chelsea Handler, Fortune Feimster, and other notable comedians. Her one-hour special Talking to Myself was executive produced by Bill Burr and debuted on Comedy Central. She is a regular on This Week at the Comedy Cellar and has appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The View, HBO‚Äôs, Crashing, and Kevin Can Wait. She also recently acted in and served as a consultant, producer, and writer on the Robert De Niro film The Comedian.

Jessica‚Äôs highly anticipated prank call album, The Call Girls, also featuring Rachel Feinstein, was released on September 24th. Recorded virtually during the depths of quarantine, the album features characters such as old Jewish grandmothers, sexy co-eds, a conservative mother and her gay son, and more.

Jessica‚Äôs characters are coming to life in her new podcast, Disgusting Hawk with rave reviews. Through her Relatively Sane podcast, Jessica has interviewed the likes of Bill Burr, Jim Gaffigan, and Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell.

She was awarded ‚ÄúBest Female Comic‚Äù by the MAC association in New York City and received the prestigious Nightlife Award for ‚ÄúBest Stand-up Comedian.‚Äù In her spare time, Jessica is a regular contributor to The Howard Stern Show, where she produces and stars in prank calls for the program.

Now you can! Watch this tutorial to learn how to share a specific part of a podcast episode from Spotify.

#SpotifyTutorial #SpotifyPodcasts

To begin, open the Spotify app and begin playing the podcast episode you want to share. Then, skip to the point in the episode you‚Äôd like to share. Tap the pause button when you get to the exact timestamp you want the person you share the podcast with to begin listening. Then, tap the Share icon. Tap the switch labelled ‚ÄúShare from‚Äù with the timestamp you‚Äôve selected. Then, choose how you‚Äôd like to share the podcast, such as copying the link, sharing on your Instagram story, Facebook news feed or stories, Twitter, Snapchat, etc. When your friend clicks the link you‚Äôve shared to listen to the podcast, it will open in Spotify and begin playing from the exact timestamp you selected.

Lyrics:
Don‚Äôt you notice how
I get quiet when there‚Äôs no one else around
Me and you and awkward silence
Don‚Äôt you dare look at me that way
I don‚Äôt need reminders of how you don‚Äôt feel the same

Oh, the burning pain
Listening to you harp about some new soulmate
She‚Äôs so perfect
Blah, blah, blah
Oh, how I wish you‚Äôll wake up one day
Run to me confess your love
At least just let me say

That when I talk to you
Oh, cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon
But don‚Äôt you feel it, too?
Confess I loved you from the start

What‚Äôs a girl to do
Lying on my bed staring
Into the blue
Unrequited terrifying
Love is driving me a bit insane
Have to get this off my chest
I‚Äôm telling you today

That when I talk to you
Oh, cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon
But don‚Äôt you feel it, too?
Confess I loved you from the start

Confess I loved you
Just thinking of you
I know I‚Äôve loved you from the start

please pause the video as needed if you need more time following the tutorial :)

-- table of contents (time stamps) --
(1) iphone + accessories: 0:25
(2) lock screen - customization + widgets [app widgetopia: weather, moon phase, animated dancing cat]: 1:07
(3) home screen
¬ª downloading widgets [app Top Widgets: calendar, to-do list]: 2:14
¬ª creating widgets [app widgetopia: ribbon widget]: 3:28
¬ª customize icon pictures [app Shortcuts]: 4:25
¬ª iphone dock transparent icons [app Canva + Shortcuts]: 5:50
(4) other frequently used widgets (my second home page): 7:20
[lifestyle: I am / productivity: Top Widgets / social: Locket]

-- troubleshooting --
(a) iphone dock transparent icons: 5:50
¬ª¬ª if you get the message ""unable to paste content"" on the Canva app when you try to paste your sticker onto the design, press ""got it"" and then try pasting it again in the same way. it should work the second time! 

¬ª¬ª if you don‚Äôt have the sticker feature on the iphone, you can use the ‚Äúbackground remover‚Äù feature on Canva (use the free Pro trial if needed) to remove the background of your picture. still use the same process of setting the background color of your logo design based on whether you have dark mode on/off. if you're using a desktop/laptop, send the finished image back to your phone.

let me know if you have any other questions! i'll try my best, but pls remember that i'm not an expert lol

This week brought another Windows Update and return of the problem. This time, however, there was no Power Management Tab in the Bluetooth Device Manager.

the point of this video is not to bash male fashion for being less ""extra"" - it's to reflect on us women criticizing each other's outfits for being too basic or simple yet praising men for wearing the same thing, so let's just let women wear what we want!! (also just thinking about how gendered fashion is)

Notion and Cron just launched their first true integration. Within Cron, you can now easily attach Notion pages to any event. The integration shows you recent pages from your connected Notion workspace, and you can also search for any page or create a new page directly from Cron.

Attached pages are visible to meeting attendees, and you'll also get the option to give attendees permissiont to access/edit those pages if they're in your Notion workspace.

One thing this new integration doesn't do, though, is sync events from your Notion workspace to your calendar.

So I've also shipped a simple Pipedream workflow that will do this for new events, pushing them from Notion to Google Calendar. I'm working on an even better version that will push updates and deletions from Notion to Google Calendar as well, so keep your eyes peeled for that!"

It is time ‚Äî time for a new favorite productivity app.
If you‚Äôve been here for a while you know that I do change my productivity apps once in a while, but I‚Äôm usually pretty faithful to a few solid choices. For instance, I‚Äôve been using Notion since 2019, it‚Äôs what I use to organize all of my ideas and notes, both personal or business related and I do still swear by it. 
However, my task management system has always fluctuated throughout the years ‚Äî I never truly felt like I found something incredible to manage tasks and subtasks. Calendar blocking in Google Calendar is the closest I ever got to perfection, despite its shortcomings (more about that in this video). 
But now ‚Äî I think I finally found a winner.

Calendar blocking is a time management technique that allows you to schedule everything in a calendar system (like Google Calendar) in a daily and weekly view. With these time slots, you are able to see exactly what tasks you should be working on, and how your life, business and other activities are balanced out throughout the week.

We‚Äôre all tired of Google Calendar by this point, right? Although it‚Äôs still the Calendar Blocking holy grail, time blocking apps have grown exponentially over the years. You now have incredible alternatives that were engineered from scratch for this specific time management technique. 

So in this video we are going to look at 5 great google calendar alternatives, their different features and how to use them and then at the end I‚Äôll give you my verdict on the app I would pick out of this group.

By taking marginal notes in the books, essays, journal articles, etc., and moving the most important notes to a commonplace book and by taking notes from audio mediums like podcasts, courses, and YouTube presentations in your commonplace book, you can create a one-stop-shop for building expertise.

AOIKTYE Keypad 2 (Keypad for Procreate on iPad) Review,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX5D1PQyzrg,Myles Hi Art,Howto & Style,"['psdboy', 'procreate keypad', 'ayokitye keyboard', 'procreate keyboard', 'aioktye keypad', 'procreate', 'oikotie keyboard for procreate', 'topro keypad', 'aok type keyboard for procreate review']",2023-08-31T01:04:06.042Z,"Today in the mail I got a new procreate keyboard, from Aoiktye. First of all if you dont know about these, this is a keypad that‚Äôs made specifically to work with procreate!  Its not made by procreate, but it really feels like it was, the way it works so well as a companion.  You might be wondering in your head why would you want to get a keypad for procreate? Procreate already has all these gestures that are programmed into it so you can just swipe and tap everything with your pencil right?  

Yeah, but I just personally find the keypad to be a tool that can really speed up your work flow.   To me, pressing a button with my right hand, while I continue to draw with my left hand, is faster than stopping to swipe the screen with my left hand, then continue drawing or whatever.   It might not seem like much with one action, but when you‚Äôve had to swipe the screen or tap the screen to grab different tools over the entire course of the project, the time you spend doing that really starts to add up.

Some of us procreate users also use photoshop or came from a photoshop background, where we got used to using keyboard shortcuts to bring up different tools.  If you‚Äôre that person, then this product really is aimed at you.  And lastly, if you‚Äôre the type of artist who works at a tabletop or a desk, then this is going to be a comfortable addition to your work station. Its not a tool where you can be like, in public on the subway drawing and using the tool.  It feels like its made to be used at a table or desk.

The packaging is better than it previously was, so thats a plus.  With the device you‚Äôre gonna get a small micro usb cable to charge it.  And you should start charging it as soon as you open it because this thing is gonna take two hours to get to full charge.  But the good news is, once its charged, you almost never have to think about charging it ever again its actually crazy how good the battery life is on this thing.  

Right after its charged for the first time, you can turn the switch on and immediately its gonna go into pairing mode.  From there you just tap on your settings in the iPad, open the bluetooth options and pick aoiktye.  Then its gonna connect, and its ready to go in procreate.

This one is the second generation of their keypad.  The first keypad was pretty good, but there were a couple things lacking.  This generation made up for that.  This time around, you can adjust the brush size with a bit more precision than before, which was a main thing that really bothered me on the first model.  You can also clear layers from the keypad now.  Its elevated at a slightly higher angle than the last for better comfort on your wrist.  

Because of the way the command key sits on the right, this keypad seems like its made to work with right handed artists.  I think I prefer the spot where the command button was on the first model, but still, as a left handed artist I found no issue getting used to working with it.  The button rests right below my pinky.

How to measure your body fat %,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2J4leGs5x0,Lee Lem,Sports,[''],2023-08-31T00:38:14.095Z,"How do you measure your body fat %? üìè

The cheapest and easiest method is probably the Navy method. However, keep in mind that all body fat measuring methods will have a margin of error - even the DEXA scans can show an incorrect number. 

I would generally add an extra 3-5% for whatever you're estimating, however, what truly matter is the consistency. 

Body fat isn't something I would recommend measuring - especially if you're not competing as honestly... Who tf cares? If you're lean, you're lean. In my case, this is the first time I've actually started measuring my body fat as I'm going to be using it in combination with my body weight to see where I'm roughly at leading up to my bodybuilding competition near the end of the year. 

NAVY METHOD: 

Things you'll need:
- Rope measuring tape
- Steel measuring tape
- Body weight scale

Do this as consistently as possible - preferably in the morning after you've gone to the bathroom and before you eat anything. 

You'll need 4 measurements:
1. Waist (at the naval)
2. Neck (at the thinnest below your Adam's apple)
3. Your height
4. Your weight

Choose any Navy body fat calculator you want (I chose bizcalcs) and input the values.

The Best Way to Estimate Body Fat Percentage at Home,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEcQZ-iGQys,Fit and 50,People & Blogs,[''],2023-08-31T00:38:11.540Z,"I‚Äôve used 3 different methods to estimate body fat percentage at home: bioelectric impedance, callipers and the Navy method. By far, the Navy method is the cheapest and easiest to use. 

If you‚Äôre a man, you need 3 different measurements, and a woman needs 4. You plug these measurements into a formula, and there‚Äôs your approximate body fat percentage.

Both men and women need to have their height, waist and neck measurements in inches. Women also need to have their hip measurement. 

The neck is measured below the Adam's apple and above the traps. 

Men measure their relaxed waist circumference at the belly button, and women use the narrowest part of their waist and the widest point of the hips.

Then plug this information into the formula shown on the screen; if you‚Äôre like me and not a math major, I‚Äôll leave a link in the top comment to an online calculator. Just plug in your measurements, and it‚Äôll give you the answer.

For Men:
Body fat % = 86.010 x log10(waist - neck) - 70.041 x log10(height) + 36.76

For Women:
Body fat % = 163.205 x log10(waist + hip - neck) - 97.684 x log10(height) - 78.387

4 ONE-MINUTE Habits That Save Me 20+ Hours a Week - Time Management For Busy People,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5i8alK5hPo,Liam Porritt,Education,"['time management', 'save time', 'productive habits', 'how to manage your time', 'habits', 'work efficiently', 'productivity', 'time management tips', 'time management techniques']",2023-08-25T11:43:33.903Z,"The first 100 people to download Endel will get a free week of audio experiences - https://app.adjust.com/b8wxub6?campaign=liamporritt_January2023&adgroup=youtube

In our busy lives, a few hours a week means time for a date, or a few hours of self-love pruning in the bath - so imagine what you could do with 10, 20 or even more extra time each week ü§Ø 

Well, from reading some of the best time management books out there, these are my top 4 quick habits to efficiently manage your time, which save me hours each week üôå They are simple, but hugely effective techniques to make the most of our 16 or so waking hours a day, and honestly are some of the core techniques that allow me to keep up a demanding career as a corporate lawyer, while running multiple businesses on the side üë®‚Äçüíª

The key to these habits is (as with all habits) consistency‚Ä¶ kinda obvious, I know. But with these habits especially, they really don‚Äôt take much effort, but they do require a consistent consciousness of how you are working. So, try to keep each of these in mind as you get ready for, and then during, each of your work sessions ü´∂

About Me

I'm a lawyer, part-time YouTuber, son, brother, startup founder, fianc√©, black coffee drinker and plant dad. I graduated from Cambridge University (where I studied French and Spanish), topped my law school class and now work for a corporate law firm in London as a trainee solicitor (which takes up a lot of my time)!

Around that, I'm a big fan of discovering new ways of thinking, of balancing work with life, and of performing to the very best of my ability. Ohh, and being happy. And I try to share all that on this YouTube channel üòÄ

Fun fact: I believe we massively overplay the role of ‚Äúnatural talent‚Äù üòÆ AND‚Ä¶ I also believe that TOGETHER, WE ARE ALL CAPABLE OF POSITIVITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND SUCCESS.

Notion and Cron just launched their first true integration. Within Cron, you can now easily attach Notion pages to any event. The integration shows you recent pages from your connected Notion workspace, and you can also search for any page or create a new page directly from Cron.

Attached pages are visible to meeting attendees, and you'll also get the option to give attendees permissiont to access/edit those pages if they're in your Notion workspace.

One thing this new integration doesn't do, though, is sync events from your Notion workspace to your calendar.

So I've also shipped a simple Pipedream workflow that will do this for new events, pushing them from Notion to Google Calendar. I'm working on an even better version that will push updates and deletions from Notion to Google Calendar as well, so keep your eyes peeled for that!"
How To Build Muscle At Home: The BEST Full Body Home Workout For Growth,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95846CBGU0M,Jeremy Ethier,People & Blogs,"['home workout', 'full body home workout', 'bodyweight workout at home', 'bodyweight exercises', 'home full body workout', 'build muscle at home', 'build muscle at home no equipment', 'home exercises', 'home workout without equipment', 'home workout for men', 'home workout bodyweight', 'home workout without weights', 'how to build muscle at home', 'home workout for beginners', 'back home workout', 'how to build muscle at home without equipment', 'bodyweight workout', 'no equipment workout', 'jeremyethier']",2023-08-24T17:50:45.867Z,"In today‚Äôs video we‚Äôll go through a science-based full body home workout routine. When we think of a home workout, we assume that they‚Äôre inferior for muscle growth. For many bodyweight workout at home routines out there, this is true. But, this is simply because they aren‚Äôt designed properly. You can make comparable gains in muscle mass by using either lighter loads (like bodyweight exercises), or heavier weights in the gym. But there are a couple key points that people overlook when it comes to home full body workout routines.

First off, is that you need to push to near failure for every single set you perform in this full body home workout routine. If you stop well short of failure during your sets then you‚Äôll fail to fully activate all the motor units within your muscles. And you won‚Äôt experience the same amount of growth that you would when using heavy weights. Secondly, you need to be working with a weight or resistance that is at least 30-40% of your 1 rep max if you want to maximize growth. So 30-40% of your 1 rep max equates to around 30-40 reps per set. So, make sure you can‚Äôt do more than that for the following exercises.

All that said, we‚Äôre now ready to dive into the full home workout. The first exercise we‚Äôll use here are narrow grip push-ups with the hands placed in a diamond shape, which will be used to target the chest and triceps. Next, we‚Äôll use the inverted row to target our overall back with most of the emphasis on the mid back for thickness. Then, the third exercise is pike push-ups, which mainly target the shoulders and triceps. Now, it‚Äôs time to target the back, primarily the lats, with a vertical pulling angle through the sliding lat pulldowns.

The fifth of the bodyweight exercises is the bicep towel curls, which allows for arms isolation. Then, to target the long head of the triceps, you can simply switch over and perform tricep extensions in your setup for the bicep curls. For most of us, bodyweight squats just aren‚Äôt going to cut it. Which is why we‚Äôll use the towel set up again to perform assisted pistol squats to target the quads and glutes. For the eighth exercise, we‚Äôll move onto the Bulgarian split squat with your rear leg elevated on a platform, which will again further target the quads and glutes. Lastly, we‚Äôll use the sliding leg curl to work the hamstrings through both hip and knee extension.

Now, as for your home workout routine, just like your exercises in the gym, it‚Äôs vital that you get adequate rest of roughly 2 minutes between each of your sets. And to do so in this workout while saving time, you can perform the following upper body exercises in a superset fashion:

Home workout (superset):

SUPERSET:
Diamond Push-Ups: (4 sets ‚Äì 2 flat, 2 decline)
Inverted row (4 sets)

SUPERSET:
Pike Push-ups (3 sets)
Lat pulldowns on floor (3 sets)

SUPERSET:
Biceps towel curl: 2 sets 
Tricep bodyweight extensions: 2 sets

Assisted pistol squat: 3 sets each side
Bulgarian split squat 3 sets each side
Hamstring leg curls: 4 sets

I‚Äôd recommend performing this full body home workout 3-4 times a week.

Guys I hope you enjoyed this one and I also hope you were able to see that it‚Äôs the little details like what I went through in this video that really are key to maximizing growth and to actually see progress with whatever workout routine you choose to do. And for a step-by-step program that takes care of all the guess work for you and shows you exactly how and what to work out and eat week after week so that you can fuel your body and build muscle most effectively with science, then simply take the analysis quiz to discover which science-based program would be best for you and where your body is currently at below:

How To Build Muscle At Home: The BEST Full Body Home Workout For Growth,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95846CBGU0M,Jeremy Ethier,People & Blogs,"['home workout', 'full body home workout', 'bodyweight workout at home', 'bodyweight exercises', 'home full body workout', 'build muscle at home', 'build muscle at home no equipment', 'home exercises', 'home workout without equipment', 'home workout for men', 'home workout bodyweight', 'home workout without weights', 'how to build muscle at home', 'home workout for beginners', 'back home workout', 'how to build muscle at home without equipment', 'bodyweight workout', 'no equipment workout', 'jeremyethier']",2023-08-24T00:51:28.809Z,"In today‚Äôs video we‚Äôll go through a science-based full body home workout routine. When we think of a home workout, we assume that they‚Äôre inferior for muscle growth. For many bodyweight workout at home routines out there, this is true. But, this is simply because they aren‚Äôt designed properly. You can make comparable gains in muscle mass by using either lighter loads (like bodyweight exercises), or heavier weights in the gym. But there are a couple key points that people overlook when it comes to home full body workout routines.

First off, is that you need to push to near failure for every single set you perform in this full body home workout routine. If you stop well short of failure during your sets then you‚Äôll fail to fully activate all the motor units within your muscles. And you won‚Äôt experience the same amount of growth that you would when using heavy weights. Secondly, you need to be working with a weight or resistance that is at least 30-40% of your 1 rep max if you want to maximize growth. So 30-40% of your 1 rep max equates to around 30-40 reps per set. So, make sure you can‚Äôt do more than that for the following exercises.

All that said, we‚Äôre now ready to dive into the full home workout. The first exercise we‚Äôll use here are narrow grip push-ups with the hands placed in a diamond shape, which will be used to target the chest and triceps. Next, we‚Äôll use the inverted row to target our overall back with most of the emphasis on the mid back for thickness. Then, the third exercise is pike push-ups, which mainly target the shoulders and triceps. Now, it‚Äôs time to target the back, primarily the lats, with a vertical pulling angle through the sliding lat pulldowns.

The fifth of the bodyweight exercises is the bicep towel curls, which allows for arms isolation. Then, to target the long head of the triceps, you can simply switch over and perform tricep extensions in your setup for the bicep curls. For most of us, bodyweight squats just aren‚Äôt going to cut it. Which is why we‚Äôll use the towel set up again to perform assisted pistol squats to target the quads and glutes. For the eighth exercise, we‚Äôll move onto the Bulgarian split squat with your rear leg elevated on a platform, which will again further target the quads and glutes. Lastly, we‚Äôll use the sliding leg curl to work the hamstrings through both hip and knee extension.

Now, as for your home workout routine, just like your exercises in the gym, it‚Äôs vital that you get adequate rest of roughly 2 minutes between each of your sets. And to do so in this workout while saving time, you can perform the following upper body exercises in a superset fashion:

Home workout (superset):

SUPERSET:
Diamond Push-Ups: (4 sets ‚Äì 2 flat, 2 decline)
Inverted row (4 sets)

SUPERSET:
Pike Push-ups (3 sets)
Lat pulldowns on floor (3 sets)

SUPERSET:
Biceps towel curl: 2 sets 
Tricep bodyweight extensions: 2 sets

Assisted pistol squat: 3 sets each side
Bulgarian split squat 3 sets each side
Hamstring leg curls: 4 sets

I‚Äôd recommend performing this full body home workout 3-4 times a week.

Guys I hope you enjoyed this one and I also hope you were able to see that it‚Äôs the little details like what I went through in this video that really are key to maximizing growth and to actually see progress with whatever workout routine you choose to do. And for a step-by-step program that takes care of all the guess work for you and shows you exactly how and what to work out and eat week after week so that you can fuel your body and build muscle most effectively with science, then simply take the analysis quiz to discover which science-based program would be best for you and where your body is currently at below:

Training with are bodyweight also helps us achieve a lean athletic body and gives us the strength to control our bodyweight. Weights are great too and using them we can grow and target the muscles.

ü•≥ Sign up for my free productivity tips newsletter! ‚û°Ô∏è http://go.dabido.com.au/newsletter  

== DESCRIPTION == 
I'm dabi, a doctor and YouTuber, and I've made the single most in-depth YouTube guide to Obsidian on the internet. I've created this 13-part course that was initially $97, but now I've released it to you for free!

This is my opinionated guide to how I use Obsidian as a Second Brain and Zettelkasten. 
- Make Obsidian a digital Second Brain, so that you never ever forget anything you think about 
- Use Obsidian as a Zettelkasten 
- Capture thoughts extremely quickly, without worrying about structure until later 
- Use Obsidian's powerful search functions to find anything you've ever thought about 
- Synthesise and distill important ideas as part of a Zettelkasten, so that your most important thoughts are always top of mind 
- ...and more! 

I spent a ridiculous amount of time on this course (a *ridiculous* amount), because originally I set out to make the most in-depth paid course. 

üìö Make sure to bookmark it and share it with your friends, so you can come back to it as needed! There's no need to do it in one go, as originally it was meant to be done one lesson at a time. 

üéâ THIS VIDEO IS FULLY SUBTITLED. I've tried to make the subtitles as accurate as possible, to make things easier to understand, so I recommend turning them on. :) but I do apologise if I mess up here and there. 

00:00:00 - Once $97, now a YouTube video!

== WHO AM I? == 
I'm Dr David Liu - a medical doctor (specialised in General Practice/Family Medicine) and YouTuber who loves anime. :) My channel is about medicine, tech, note-taking software, books, anime, and AI! I nerd out a lot about ways to do things smarter and ways to create cool stuff.

These are the 5 techniques and attributes that I have seen to be critical milestones in a learner's development.

Whether you're a beginner looking to become a more efficient student or an already top achiever pursuing even further self-improvement, these 5 steps are things that I think can benefit you.

1. Priming/prestudy - priming as I mentioned is a big topic and shouldn't be thought of simply as ""prestudy"". Whatever notion you have of prestudy to begin with should be abandoned. See if the way I explain it is the same as how you understand it.

2. Event engagement - in class or lecture. What are you doing to increase your effectiveness in the primary learning event? How much control do you exert here?

3. Post-event review - when do you do it and...

4. Review technique - HOW do you consolidate the information in your post-event review.

5. Pre-exam or test preparation - are you using this time effectively, or just creating an illusion of preparation?

If you enjoyed what I had to give or found it valuable, a subscribe would be sincerely appreciated.

Get ready for a wild adventure and watch the YouTube version (available on Tuesday) to see... actually, I don't want to spoil it. But let's just say, it rhymes with ""Grapes"" if you know what I mean ;)

The fitness industry has messed up our relationship with food. We are obsessed with image creation, fast hacks, and drastic diets. 

I hope this video helps some people in rethinking their relationship with dieting. There is a way and it's not just about eating healthy ;)"

How Meditation Works & Science-Based Effective Meditations | Huberman Lab Podcast #96,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTBSGgbIvsY,Andrew Huberman,Science & Technology,"['andrew huberman', 'huberman lab podcast', 'huberman podcast', 'dr. andrew huberman', 'neuroscience', 'huberman lab', 'andrew huberman podcast', 'the huberman lab podcast', 'science podcast', 'meditation', 'meditation practice', 'how to meditate', 'interoception', 'exteroception', 'breathwork']",2023-08-21T14:21:28.591Z,"In this episode, I discuss the biological mechanisms of the state changes that occur during different types of meditation and describe how to develop the meditation practice optimal for you. I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level. I also explain the concept behind the ‚Äúthird-eye center,‚Äù what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability. Whether you are a novice or an experienced meditator or simply interested in how our brain controls different aspects of conscious awareness and self-regulation, this episode should interest you.

Why Do Japanese Games Handle Trans Characters so Differently?

Happy Pride Month! If you play a lot of Japanese games, or consume Japanese media, you might notice that there is quite an abundance of gender non-conforming, crossdressing, and trans characters... but not very many gay or lesbian characters, by comparison.

In the West, T acceptance has been much slower than LGB acceptance, but in the East, this trend is largely the opposite. Why is that? And what does this have to do with video games?

In this Pride Month special, we'll be looking at the history and development of characters like Birdo and Bridget to see what we can learn about cultural differences in the area of gender studies. Join me in this (I hope) politically neutral and interesting look into Trans Characters in Japanese Games.

Chorus:
Sometimes it's soft as a misty rain
That gently touches my soul
It cools the fire that burns in me
And I simply lose control
So just

Rain down (on) on me
Let your love just fall like rain
Just rain on me
Just rain down (on) on me
Let your love just shower me
Just rain on me

Chorus:
I get so weak in the knees, I can hardly speak (I lose)
I lose all control and something takes over me (Control, takes over me)
In a daze and it's so amazing (Amaze)
It's not a phase (It's not), I want you to stay with me (Stay with me)
By my side, I swallow my pride (My pride)
Your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
Can't explain why your lovin' makes me weak

‚ù§Ô∏è Today I'll go over how to design a language learning strategy that you can fit in alongside a busy schedule. I work full-time as a doctor in London, and on the side I learn Mandarin in any free time I can get - I know how hard it can be to make time for goals beyond around full-time studies/work. I'll share my top tips on how to juggle the two and make the most of any spare time you have for language learning.

Based on the internet‚Äôs ethnicity swappers Hall of Fame starring: Oli London, Rachel Dolezol, Martina Big, and Xianh Nishi ‚Äì it seems to be isolated incidents that don‚Äôt happen very often. Recently a community called RCTA or ECTA has been gaining traction, which stands for race or ethnicity change to another. They claim you can turn into any race you want by listening to subliminals, supporting the community by creating RCTA content on TikTok and progress-checking each other on Discord. It‚Äôs pretty wild and they seem to be more focused on changing from Caucasian to Chinese, Japanese, or Korean. The prevalence of Asian media all over the world has made impressionable young people want to connect with these cultures‚Ä¶ by morphing into one of them.

So , this video has no claims on it (subject to change of course) but this is because I edited each song individually and then uploaded them individually at a low quality to test what needed to be edited, safe to say this took hours and hours and hours !! I know the editing style is different now but I'm fed up with my videos getting demonetised. Remember these videos are about my reaction OF COURSE and I definitely keep all the best bits in and of course my thoughts and analysis! If you would rather see it in all it's glory then head over to Patreon ! Much Love !

Post Malone: Tiny Desk Concert,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCcks-fwq2c,NPR Music,Music,"['NPR', 'NPR Music', 'National Public Radio', 'Live', 'Performance', 'tiny desk', 'tiny desk concert', 'tony desk', 'tiny concert']",2023-08-15T20:30:17.037Z,"Stephen Thompson | August 15, 2023
The Tiny Desk has hosted plenty of major pop, rock and hip-hop stars in its 15-plus years, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one more agreeable or self-effacing than Austin Richard Post. Whether lamenting the state of his singing voice, joking about his nerves or sitting slack-jawed in awe of the fantastic band his people had assembled for this show, Post had the bearing of a lottery winner who wouldn't even give himself credit for buying a ticket.

Before, during and after the show, Post Malone was a joy to have around. But he also just happened to bring a few of the biggest pop hits of the 21st century: Set-opener ""Sunflower,"" for example, has been certified eighteen-times platinum by the RIAA since its release in 2018 ‚Äî that's an all-time record ‚Äî while the 2017 single ""I Fall Apart"" and 2019's ""Circles"" lag behind at a mere ten-times platinum apiece. ""Enough Is Enough,"" which closes this set, enjoys no such designation, but give it time: A track from Post Malone's new album Austin, it's only been out for a few weeks.

So enjoy this set for what it is: one of the world's biggest stars, performing a few of the world's biggest songs, each set to a luminous arrangement. Post Malone himself seems surprised by how great this Tiny Desk concert sounds, and that's not just the humility talking.

The Best Science-Based Leg Day For Growth (Quads/Glutes/Hamstrings) | PUSH PULL LEGS SERIES,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg9B6pqHUQE,Jeremy Ethier,People & Blogs,"['push pull legs routine', 'leg workout', 'quad exercises', 'glute exercises', 'legs workout', 'glute workout', 'squat workout', 'full leg workout', 'workout for legs', 'workout for bigger legs', 'how to get bigger legs', 'how to build bigger legs', 'perfect leg workout', 'exercises for quads', 'exercises for hamstrings', 'best leg workout', 'leg workout for men', 'back squat', 'front squat', 'hip thrust', 'lunges workout', 'split squat', 'butt exercises', 'big legs workout', 'big legs workout for men', 'jeremyethier']",2023-08-15T15:55:29.431Z,"This video is the final installment of my 3-part push pull legs routine series. In this video, we‚Äôll cover your leg workout for the week. The first exercise will be barbell squats, which has been shown to be one of the best quad exercises (not to mention, glute exercises). I‚Äôd recommend the front squat over the back squat for two reasons. First, the front squat achieves comparable levels of muscle activation when using roughly 20% lighter weight than the back squat. Second, research has shown that the front squat produces significantly lower compressive forces on the knee as well as reduced lumbar stress when compared to back squats. Regardless, incorporating both into your legs workout is a great idea.

Next is the barbell hip thrusts, one of the best glutes exercises available. The hip thrust provides a much greater glutes contraction and puts a high amount of tension and metabolic stress on the glutes when they‚Äôre in a shortened position at the top of the movement ‚Äì something that the squat fails to do. Lastly, hip thrusts are very low impact on the joints and easy on the lower back, yet still enables you to lift heavy weights. Therefore, including them in your push pull legs routine is recommended.

The next exercise is the split squats, one of the best quad exercises with considerable involvement from the glutes and hamstrings as well. Include at least one unilateral movement to prevent imbalances from developing over time. Split squats also offer significant advantages over walking lunges. They‚Äôre easier and safer to learn, which means that you‚Äôll be able to perform it with full range of motion and a significantly higher glute medius activation. Once your balance improves with this, rather than progressing to walking lunges, you‚Äôll want to then progress to the Bulgarian split squat. And then, once you‚Äôre able to comfortably do this variation, what I‚Äôd recommend is to progress it once more by performing half of your sets with the contralateral Bulgarian split squat, where you hold just one dumbbell on the opposite hand as your front leg.

Lastly, we‚Äôre going to include the glute ham raise in your legs workout. It is a great exercise to do so as it elicits the greatest activation of the various hamstring muscles when compared to other common hamstring exercises. In addition, it also forces you to control your bodyweight on the way down or eccentric portion of every rep. This is important given that research has shown that it‚Äôs this eccentric strengthening of the hamstrings that seems to be the most important factor for not only enhancing your athletic performance such as with the vertical jump, but also for better protecting your hamstrings from any future potential injuries or imbalances. 

For calves, I‚Äôd simply recommend adding in one standing calf raise exercise and one seated calf raise to ensure that both calf muscles are hit, and a mix of higher and lower rep ranges. 

To sum everything up for you, here‚Äôs what your leg workout could look like:

Back Squats OR Front Squats: 3-4 sets of 6-10 reps
Hip Thrusts: 3-4 sets of 12-15 reps
Split Squats (2 sets Bulgarian, 2 sets contralateral): 4 sets of 8-12 reps (each side)
Glute Ham Raise (or Bosu Ball alternative): 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps
Standing Single Leg Calf Raise: 2-4 sets of 6-10 reps
Seated Calf Raise: 2-4 sets of 10-15 reps

To maximize your time and efforts and build muscle in the fastest way possible, then you need to not only carefully select each and every exercise that you perform in your workouts, but you also need to know how to then go about executing and implementing them into your overall routine. And for a step-by-step program that takes care of all the guess work for you and shows you exactly how and what to workout week after week so that you can build muscle most effectively with science, then take the analysis quiz below to discover which approach is best for you:

Here, I‚Äôll cover a sample science-based pull workout to now target the various back muscles, the biceps, and the rear delts. First off, it‚Äôs important you understand the overall setup of this pull day workout. The first 4 exercises will rotate between vertical pulling movements and horizontal rowing movements. It‚Äôs beneficial to rotate from one to the other throughout the workout to not only work our back muscles from different angles, but to also avoid overstraining stabilizer muscles. We‚Äôll then finish the workout off with 2 accessory movements to work the smaller muscle groups.

The first exercise we‚Äôll include in this pull workout are pull-ups, which are one of the best exercises for targeting the lats to increase the width of your back. The pull-up activates various other back and arm muscles to a high degree as well, meaning that it‚Äôs a great overall back builder and therefore should be a staple in your routine. Next, it‚Äôs time to switch the angle of pull by moving to a horizontal pulling movement with the barbell row, which is not only be a greater overall back builder, but is especially useful for mid-back thickness and lower back development.

Next, for our pull day workout, is the lat pulldown. Rather than the wide traditional overhand grip, we‚Äôll be switching to a closer underhand grip. Doing so involves more shoulder extension and has an angle of pull that is more vertical and in line with the lower lat fibers‚Äìallowing us to emphasize the lower lats for maximized back width. We‚Äôll then move back to a horizontal rowing movement similar to the barbell row, but performed in a way that will emphasize the rear delt. If we widen our grip to enable us to flare the elbows out more as we pull, the rear delts are now put in a more advantageous position and the involvement of the lats is minimized. 

Next, it‚Äôs time to move onto some isolation work for the biceps, but more specifically we‚Äôll be targeting the long head of the biceps. The close grip barbell curl is a great exercise for this purpose because by both keeping the elbows close to the body and using a narrower grip that‚Äôs within shoulder-width, we‚Äôll be able to put the outer head or long head of the biceps in a more advantageous position. Lastly, we‚Äôre going to finish off the workout with facepulls, which will be mainly used to work the rear delts, mid and lower traps, and our various rotator cuff muscles. For the first 2 sets, you‚Äôll want to focus on externally rotating the shoulder at the end position to best strengthen the rotator cuffs. For the last 2 sets, you‚Äôll want to switch to lying face pulls to now further emphasize the rear delts. 

Here‚Äôs what your pull workout in a typical push pull legs routine could look like:

Pull-Ups: 3-4 sets of 6-10 reps OR Kneeling Lat Pulldowns: 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps
Barbell Row: 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps
Reverse Grip Pulldowns: 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps
Chest Supported Rear Delt Row: 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps
Narrow Grip Barbell Curl: 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps
Kneeling Face Pulls: 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps

Guys I hope you enjoyed this one and you were able to see that to maximize your time and efforts and build muscle in the fastest way possible, then you need to not only carefully select each and every exercise that you perform in your workouts, but you also need to know how to then go about executing and implementing them into your overall routine. 

And for a step-by-step program that takes care of all the guess work for you and shows you exactly how and what to workout week after week so that you can build muscle most effectively with science, just like countless of our members have done with their Built With Science programs, then simply take the analysis quiz to discover which science-based program would be best for you and where your body is currently at below:

The Best Science-Based Full Body Workout for Size and Strength (‚ÄúWorkout B‚Äù),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWcJuLKB7RY,Jeremy Ethier,People & Blogs,"['full body workout', 'full body workouts', 'best full body workout', 'total body workout', 'full body workout routine', 'full body workout plan', 'full body workout at gym', 'full body workout for mass', 'full body workout for beginners', 'full body workout with weights', 'full body workout with dumbbells', 'full body routine', 'full body routine for mass', 'full body routine workout', 'total body workout with weights', 'workout splits for mass', 'jeremyethier', 'builtwithscience', 'workout', 'muscle']",2023-08-15T14:09:23.636Z,"Full body workouts (or ‚Äútotal body workouts‚Äù) are one of the best workout routines for muscle growth, size, and strength. A full body workout split enables you to train each muscle group sufficiently yet in a much more time efficient manner than other workout routines. But, it‚Äôs vital that you structure your full body workout properly in order to reap the benefits that a full body workout routine can provide. In part 2 of this full body workout series, I‚Äôll cover ‚Äúworkout B‚Äù to be used in conjunction with ‚Äúworkout A‚Äù covered in my previous video.

The first exercise is the barbell deadlift. This will be the most taxing movement of the workout and will be used to target the whole posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings, lower back, and upper back muscles). Feel free to use other variations other than the conventional deadlift.

The next exercise will be the incline dumbbell press. This exercise will be used to target the upper chest which is often lagging. It‚Äôs especially important to include this exercise within this full body workout since in ‚Äúworkout A‚Äù we used the flat barbell bench press, which doesn‚Äôt prioritize the upper chest.

The third exercise here will be the chest supported row. This can be done on an inclined bench with a bar or dumbbells for greater range of motion, on a chest-supported machine, or with the inverted row. The key here is to pick a rowing movement that minimizes spinal loading on the lower back. This helps us better target the upper back muscles since the lower back muscles will already be fatigued from the deadlifts performed in ‚Äúworkout A‚Äù.

Next, we‚Äôll move onto the Bulgarian split squat. This exercise will compliment the strength of our back squat in ‚Äúworkout A‚Äù quite well. If you struggle with balance here, you can start with a lower platform on your back foot and eventually increase the height of this.

The fifth exercise will be the dumbbell lateral raise in order to emphasize the lateral deltoid muscle. This, in conjunction with the overhead shoulder press in workout A, will provide the best shoulder growth.

The next two exercises will be accessory movements; the incline dumbbell triceps kickback and the high to low cable flies. These will be used to target the long head of the triceps and the lower chest, which hasn‚Äôt received much attention given our previous exercise selection.

The Best Science-Based PUSH Workout For Growth (Chest/Shoulders/Triceps),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWDXsqHo14A,Jeremy Ethier,People & Blogs,"['push pull legs', 'push pull legs split', 'push pull legs workout', 'push pull legs program', 'push workout', 'push day workout', 'push workout for mass', 'push workout for strength', 'push day', 'chest and triceps', 'chest workout', 'push workout routine', 'best workout split', 'push workout bodybuilding', 'upper chest workout', 'training split', 'best split for muscle growth', 'best workout routines', 'chest exercises', 'shoulder exercises', 'arms exercises', 'triceps exercises', 'shoulder workout', 'arms workout']",2023-08-15T14:04:22.220Z,"One of the most effective muscle-building workout routines you can use is the push pull legs split. In the push workout for mass, you train all of your upper body pushing muscles (chest, shoulders, and triceps). In the pull workout, you train all of your upper body pulling muscles (back, biceps, and rear delts). And in the legs workout, you train your entire lower body (quads, hamstrings, calves). The push pull legs workout is so effective because it trains each major muscle group at the optimal training frequency of 2x/week, allows plenty of recovery time for each muscle, and can be tailored to each individual. In this video, I‚Äôll show you how to get started with the push pull legs program by going through exactly how to set up one of your push day workouts for the week.


The first chest exercise to include in your push day workout is the incline barbell bench press. To maximize the activation of the upper chest and prevent the front delts from taking over, an angle of 30 degrees is optimal. A narrower grip may also boost upper chest activation and decrease front delts compensatory activation. 


The second exercise is a shoulder exercise called the standing dumbbell shoulder press, used to target the front and lateral regions of the shoulders. It elicits significantly greater front, side, and rear delt activation when compared to its barbell or seated counterparts, likely due to the greater stability requirements of this movement. 



Next, we‚Äôll be using the flat dumbbell press to emphasize the mid chest during your push workout. For this exercise, I recommend to incorporate a slight 1-2 second pause at the bottom position of each rep ‚Äì at least periodically. This not only adds some more variety, but also helps build more strength out of the bottom position. 


Next we‚Äôre going to move onto dumbbell lateral raises to prioritize the side delts. To potentially make the lateral raise even more effective, you can slightly lean in the direction of the raise. By leaning away, you‚Äôre able to remove the beginning portion of the raise and as a result shift slightly more tension onto the delts and away from the supraspinatus. 


Next, it‚Äôs time to target the lower chest with a seated decline cable fly in the push portion of your push pull legs workout. The high to low motion implemented here enables us to apply the tension in direct line with the lower fibres of the chest, and the supination of the wrists at the end will heighten the lower chest contraction you experience by enabling the elbows to travel inward to a greater degree. 


Lastly, we‚Äôre going to move onto a triceps exercise called incline dumbbell overhead extensions to target the long head of the triceps. Which is important given that it‚Äôs responsible for most of the mass of your triceps and has yet to receive much attention from our previous pushing exercises compared to the other triceps heads. 


That‚Äôs all I have for the push workout of the push pull legs program! It‚Äôs crucial that you not only have a reason behind each and every exercise that you perform in your workouts but also pay close attention to how exactly you then go about executing them, as the devil really is in the details. 


And for a step-by-step program that takes care of all the guess work for you and shows you exactly how and what to workout week after week to build muscle most effectively with science, then simply take the analysis quiz to discover which science-based program would be best for you and where your body is currently at below:

How to Lose Fat AND Gain Muscle at the Same Time (3 Simple Steps),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkv1fpWLy0Q,Jeremy Ethier,People & Blogs,[''],2023-08-15T13:52:54.980Z,"Can you build muscle and lose fat at the same time? Yes‚Äìand it‚Äôs known as body recomposition, where you build muscle and lose fat at the same time. However, recomp does come with a catch. We need to be at a calorie deficit in order to lose weight and strip off fat. But the drawback with being at a calorie deficit is that it severely compromises our ability to build muscle. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs impossible to build muscle while losing fat, and in today's video I'll share 3 steps for how to build muscle and lose fat at the same time. 

The first thing you need to do for body recomposition is setup your diet. Eat at a very slight deficit of roughly 5% to a maximum of 20%. And aim for around a protein intake of around 1g/lb of your bodyweight. Then, fill the rest of your calories with carbs and fats. 

Next, to build muscle and lose fat at the same time, beyond training your muscles at an adequate volume, switch up your routine. For example, switching to a new training split, increasing or decreasing your muscle training frequency, and/or switching up some of your exercises or the manner in which you perform them. 

Next, we need to optimize our nutrient timing so to build muscle while losing fat. First, you need to ensure that you‚Äôre evenly spreading out your daily protein intake into about 3-5 meals throughout the day. Also aim to have adequate carbs and protein shortly before and after you train. 

When it comes to the question of ‚ÄòCan you build muscle and lose fat at the same time,‚Äô the answer is yes, but you need to follow the action plan below:

Step 1 (Set Up Nutrition): Eat just slightly below maintenance calories (~5-20% deficit, or ~100-500 calories below maintenance). Multiplying your bodyweight in lbs by ~14-16 can give you an estimate as to what your maintenance calories are. Ensure your protein intake is ~1g/lb of your bodyweight, and consider going above this if you‚Äôre relatively leaner (e.g. 15% body fat or below). 

Step 2 (Switch Up Training): Switch up your training routine. Still ensure that you‚Äôre training with the optimal muscle training frequency and weekly volume, but switch up your training to provide a new stimulus for growth.

Step 3 (Optimize): Spread your daily protein intake fairly evenly into at least 3 meals per day, and ensure that you‚Äôre ingesting adequate pre AND post workout protein + carbs in a timely manner.

Bonus Step (Measure): Track your bodyweight, circumference measurements, progress pictures, and strength in the gym. Use these to variables to gauge your progress.

A body recomposition isn‚Äôt ideal for everyone, but in the cases I went through and with the protocol I previously outlined, it can be an effective way for you to shortcut your transformation. But, in the long run, you‚Äôll likely eventually want to transition to a dedicated muscle building or fat loss period and prioritize one or the other. And for an all in one, step by step program that shows you not only how to successfully achieve a body recomposition, but also then shows you exactly what to do afterwards so that you can continue to strip off fat and build lean muscle as efficiently as possible with science, then simply take the analysis quiz below to discover which specific program is best for your body and where it‚Äôs currently at:

How to Express Yourself Better,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0ST6nc6F5c,Vinh Giang,Entertainment,"['vinh giang', 'vinhgiang', 'vinh', 'giang', 'communication skills', 'how to improve your communication', 'communication tips', 'how to become a better communication', 'how to improve your voice']",2023-08-14T21:15:01.369Z,"One interaction I saw at my friend's kids birthday party inspired me to make this video üòÖ

As a communication teacher, I get asked this a lot:
""How do I get better at expressing myself?""

I didn't always speak like the way I speak now. I struggled to express my thoughts and feelings to others growing up. But one thing I did when I started to improve my communication skills was I looked to people who inspired me, saw the traits I liked in them, and adopted those habits and practiced them. Things like how people used their voice, their facial expressions, their tonality, their body language and more!

The most practical answer I can give you is look for people in your networks who inspire you and who are great at expressing themselves. Try on some of the behaviours they exhibit and practice them! 

If you struggle to express yourself and don't know how, it's okay to look to others to help you.

Dance was something that I always wanted to do because it seemed fun but I was too shy for most of my life to try it. After growing older, I realized that I wasted too much time worrying about what others thought about me instead of experiencing life the way I wanted.

So here I am at 30 years old, trying new things I‚Äôve never done before and in this video, I tried performing in a show for the first time in my life. üò≥

With an array of sketches as wide-reaching as they are cringingly accurate, the pair has created a bevy of classic characters, including Wendell, the players of the East/West Bowl and President Obama's Anger Translator.

The bug-eyed Chinchilla Persian's grumpy appearance has social media freaking out after the actor uploaded the hilarious sketch to his Instagram page.

In the dubbed video, the US star loses his mind at the straggly white cat in his backyard.

As a Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM), I treat everything from trauma including broken bones, other sports injuries, foot wounds, calluses, thick or ingrown nails; you name it! Being a #doctor is a serious job, but we can have a lighthearted side too. That's why I created this channel- to make medical themed #shorts videos for fun, while also helping to answer your questions.

$60 vs. $850 Hoodie!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlGKwiPQbHM,Asim Momin,Howto & Style,[''],2023-08-07T16:27:12.187Z,"https://www.instagram.com/asimmomin.official/

So after wearing the same two hoodies on rotation for the past few years, I decided it was time to invest in a quality pair so naturally I went out and bought one at every price point to find out where the best quality for value lies. We're going to be testing 6 hoodies to find the best hoodie for men on the market. 

Let's start with the cheapest and work our way up to find the best mens hoodie. Here we have the Champion Reverse Weave Hoodie. This has a boxy oversized fit that is super heavy. The build and finishing on it is okay but it gets by due to the price it's offered. 

Next we have American Giant's Pullover Hoodie. It's marketed as the Greatest Hoodie Ever Made was I was excited to test it out. This one was built super well, all in the USA. The details and finishing were great. This had a regular fit, not quite as relaxed as Champion or as tight as some of the other ones. The hoodie is nice and thick making it perfect for cooler days. Overall it was a huge step up in quality from the previous one. 

Let us move on to Asket's Hoodie. Asket is a great brand that makes sustainable clothing. The hoodie here was constructed well and had a cotton exterior with a terry interior. The fit was on the slimmer end but it looks great when you wear it with jeans/chinos versus joggers. You can tell that it was definitely made to wear out and look put together. 

Next we have Reigning Champs Hoodie in the head to head to find the best hoodie for men. Reigning Champs is a Reddit favorite so I was excited to get it in. It had a more deconstructed look with the flat lock seam details compared to some of the minimal options shown here. It's a thinner hoodie making it good for year round wear and the fit is similar to Asket's hoodie. 

Lady White Co is next on the list. I got my hands on two of their hoodies but am focusing on the Super Weighted hoodie. It's substantial in terms of weight and features a relaxed fit. The construction makes it seem like it's a cropped hoodie without it actually being so. It's very comfortable and the details were all perfectly executed. The fabric is an 18oz ring spun cotton with a coarse terry interior. I wear mine year round but it shines in the cooler months. 

The John Elliott Villain Hoodie was popular a few years back and was worn by a ton of celebrities. It features two zippers on the sides and a soft, thinner cotton fabric with a terry interior. The hoodie's style is quite dated but the quality is really good. The price point is high for what it provides but it's regularly found on sale.    

Finally we have Saint Laurent Rive Gauche Hoodie.  It cost $850 at retail and fit very slim so size up 1 or 2 sizes. It's a heavy cotton hoodie with features similar to Asket's Hoodie. The signature design of this hoodie is the screen printed minimal Saint Laurent Logo. It's a subtle flex and turns heads when people see you wearing it. The build on it is great but you can find similar quality at much lower prices.

Ooooh Velociraptor
If you want it faster Velociraptor

I'm a little dino
hunting on the desert
Don't let my size fool you
I've got a claw and sharp teeth

We love our feathers
and we hunt together
We are smart and nasty dinos
Our name has velocity

If it's speed you're after Velociraptor
If you want it faster Velociraptor

You won't see me coming
I creep so silently
Friends all around me
We come to attack

We're coming after, Velociraptor
We're chasing faster Velociraptor

We're fleeing faster, Velociraptor
We're running faster Velociraptor

Brachiosaurus, he has a long neck.
Brachiosaurus, might be the biggest dinosaur.
Brachiosaurus, he has a long tail.
Front legs are longer so he can reach to the tops of the trees.

Eating, eating, eating, eating, eating, eating, never stopping.
Eating, eating, eating, eating, eating, eating, never stopping.

Brachiosaurus, he has a long neck.
Brachiosaurus, he has a small brain.
Brachiosaurus, he has a long tail.
Front legs are longer so he can reach to the tops of the trees.

Eating, eating, eating, eating, eating, eating, never stopping.
Eating, eating, eating, eating, eating, eating, never stopping.

Hi guys. I am absolutely overwhelmed with the reception of my first two videos. Thank you guys so much, I deeply appreciate it. Also, thank you to all who gave me feedback regarding my pacing, volume, etc. 

My effort towards YouTube was not at all very calculated, and it was very much a spur of the moment activity for me. I will try my best to keep improving. I will also try to respond to everyone that commented across my last two videos. Your time means a lot to me and I will continue to do my best to serve it right.

Part 1: https://goo.gl/JUiFDf
-----------------------------------------------------
In this clip, Jay Park discussed the controversy surrounding his comments regarding Korea, and Korean people. The consequences of his comments led to him parting ways from the boy band that he garnered much fame from and decided to move back to the U.S. and work a regular job at a tire shop. However, Jay Park said that his time working there was peaceful and made life simple. He wasn't concerned about the fame and money he left behind. 
Later on, Jay Park details how he got back into music through covering different artists' songs, namely B.o.B.'s ""Nothing on You"" which received 2M views in a single day."

The new rookies of Hip-hop, the male duo ""GEEKS"" and the best girl group ""SISTAR"" So-You worked together to make re;code Episode I [Officially missing you, too].
The project album re;code is made by the promising artist from underground music and a famous artist's collaboration. The main character of Episode 1 is a new rookie 'GEEKS' who debuted with an acoustic hip-hop version of Tamia's [Officially missing you] that was published in 2011. 
The Episode I's track song [Officially missing you, too] is the second story of ""officially missing you"". It is a sampling song mixed with Tamia's original song along with GEEK's new intro. It tells us the story that GEEK's was not able to finish before in a new kind of rap and it will give us a real sensation and string melody.

Hi guys. I am absolutely overwhelmed with the reception of my first two videos. Thank you guys so much, I deeply appreciate it. Also, thank you to all who gave me feedback regarding my pacing, volume, etc. 

My effort towards YouTube was not at all very calculated, and it was very much a spur of the moment activity for me. I will try my best to keep improving. I will also try to respond to everyone that commented across my last two videos. Your time means a lot to me and I will continue to do my best to serve it right.

I would also like to say that you should please checkout the videos from Traversy Media, Web Dev Simplified, and an article from FreeCodeCamp on how to get out of tutorial hell.

How To Make Coding Fun,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HggHXFnPOY4,bigboxSWE,People & Blogs,[''],2023-08-03T18:14:52.502Z,"THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 15,000 SUBSCRIBERS.

I cannot believe the amount of feedback I've been getting lately.
I thank you all from the bottom of my heart so much.
Please remember to disagree with me, ask for more info, or leave any questions you may have.

This is potentially the last short-length content I will do (for the time being), as for this and prior video I was trying to learn more editing concepts (green screens, layers, etc). 

I will try my best to keep posting more of these mindset videos to help you along with your coding journey.

I cannot thank you all enough, for the feedback, your comments, and most importantly, your time.

I am so sorry about the invasive watermark on the bottom as well, it's just because a lot of my content has been stolen and reposted to Tiktok (which is an issue I've resolved, thankfully!).

Hi guys, I hope you are all well. I've been away for a few days to practice my editing and learn more about transitions, motion graphics and the likes. 

Thus, I've decided to make my videos a lot shorter just to focus on how to work all these things in.

How to Land a Tech Job is coming, but I really need to research the current environment and address ChatGPT (separate video). 

I've received so much feedback from you guys and I will try my best to respond to each and every comment and incorporate your ideas into my videos. 

I cannot thank you enough for the amount of time you have all spent watching my videos, from the bottom of my heart I am grateful I could add a bit of value to your coding journey.

Please always remember to question everything I am saying and disagree with me. Discourse makes conversations more multidimensional.

Want to know what a legitimate frontend developer interview is really like? I invited on a developer that had originally interviewed me for my second software engineering position. He interviewed a brave soul from our community that's currently trying to get his first position as a developer. Dan started out with questions to test his knowledge with JavaScript & CSS; moved into the algorithm & JavaScript fundamental portion; and then wrapped up with a React project. I think this interview turned out pretty well. What do you think?

In July, 2019, two college students who call themselves ""Team Flame"" first broke the story of the ""Nth room,"" a massive digital sex crime case where perpetrators blackmailed women including underage girls into performing sexually explicit acts on camera, with thousands of users paying in cryptocurrency to watch.

What Team Flame started off ‚Äï an investigation into distribution channels of illicit, hidden-camera videos in the hope of submitting it to a journalism exhibition ‚Äï ended up revealing a nationwide scandal in Korea that horrified the public.

Interactions among those involved in the digital sex crime-ring first began on social media services such as Twitter before conversations were moved to Telegram ‚Äï an encrypted messaging app. All of the exploitative videos were then distributed by chat room operators on Telegram to paid-up members. The number of users of the Nth Room and the ""Doctor's Room,"" where the sexually abusive content was uploaded, may have numbered anywhere between the tens of thousands to more than a quarter of a million.

Meanwhile, we're witnessing a similar phenomenon in other countries around the world ‚Äï sexual exploitation being transformed into a lucrative business ‚Äï with the advent of high-speed networks and sophisticated digital devices.

""There was also an incident in Hong Kong that was very similar to the Nth room case. We got a request from the authorities there asking us how the videos got taken down and deleted, so we shared everything we knew with them. There will be circumstances that are unique to each country, but the crime is fundamentally similar in nature,"" Seo Seung-hui, director of the Korea Cyber Sexual Violence Response Center, told The Korea Times.

Numerous Chinese-language chat rooms similar to the Nth room were also found on Telegram. ""We've gained access to four of those chat rooms which are clearly abusive, and one of them has over 30,000 users, and there are thousands more in the other ones,"" Team Flame said.

""Videos being circulated in those chat rooms included sexually-exploitative videos from the Nth room as well as others that appeared to have been filmed in China. There were thousands, tens of thousands of illicit videos being shared and distributed.""

To delve deeper into the evolving digital sex crime cases in Korea and across Asia, The Korea Times has been collaborating with four media organizations ‚Äï the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong, Tempo in Indonesia, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism and ABS-CBN in the Philippines ‚Äï on a special investigation into this issue over the last seven months.

This hour-long documentary explains what happened in the Nth room chat rooms, how girls fell prey to the perpetrators, and how the digital world and social media platforms provide an optimal environment for online sex offenses to take place. We will also be looking into how similar cases are being seen in other Asian countries, and how ‚Äï and which ‚Äï social media platforms have become a central hub for criminals in Korea, China, Japan and other parts of Asia.
