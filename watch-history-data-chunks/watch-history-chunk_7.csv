In this tutorial, we will list the possible solutions to fix Bluetooth audio stuttering in Windows 11/10. Audio stuttering is also called Sound distortion. There are several causes of this error, like corrupted or outdated drivers, frequency issues, etc. Some users have reported that the issue was fixed when they turned off their WiFi connection. This usually happens when the Bluetooth uses the same frequency as the WiFi signal does.

Issues addressed in this tutorial: 
Bluetooth audio stuttering windows 10
Bluetooth audio stuttering windows 11
audio stuttering Bluetooth headphones,
Bluetooth audio stuttering pc

If this happens, it‚Äôs possible that you have issues with your adapter, and if Bluetooth won‚Äôt turn on, it‚Äôs rather likely that there‚Äôs a driver problem.

Pairing issues can also cause sound problems, and if there‚Äôs no sound after Bluetooth connection, your device might not be properly connected to your PC.

This tutorial will apply for computers, laptops, desktops, and tablets running the Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems (Home, Professional, Enterprise, Education) from all supported hardware manufactures, like Dell, HP, Acer, Asus, Toshiba, Lenovo, Alienware, Razer, MSI, Huawei , Microsoft Surface, and Samsung."

Accented Cinema - Episode 73
Silenced (2011) is a film based on true events that happened in a school. It is one of the most difficult film I have ever watched, but also one of the most important. It is a shame that it's virtually unknown in the west. Hopefully after this video, we can all appreciate this film for what it's done for our world.

You have reached the checkpoint of the internet.

This is an age-old story beginning with taia777 in 2012, where people from all walks of life would comment about how their life is going. In 2020 that original video was removed. In that video's honour, I have kept both the original title and video, as we have all found the video recommended to us seemingly from nowhere, with a Japanese title and low-graphics thumbnail. Yet, out of curiosity, we elect to watch it and find a beautiful community of commenters

Join the taia777 sanctuary discord as well if you feel like it, it's a great place to hangout, talk, and vent. - https://discord.gg/GnsPXnU6dj

The song is from Donkey Kong Country 2 on the SNES
Stickerbush Symphony (Brambles in the Breeze / Bramble Blast) are its names and it was composed by David Wise.

I own none of this, I do not claim any of this as mine, and I do not profit off of this.

All I wish to do is preserve a truly beautiful place of the internet, once desecrated by stingy copyright owners, who don't allow for joy if they don't profit off of it. I will be placing as many of the original comments from the original video as I can find, crediting them and honouring their memories and stories. Feel free to add your own.

Also thanks to Geauser. They made a website recreating the original video, any comments made can be found there.

https://internetcheckpoint.page/zK4TWXWEKAQ - check it out.

The Feynman (pronounced ""Fine-man"") technique has changed my life. Reviewing all the study methods I've ever used, this technique easily secures a place as one of my top five study methods. The basics of the technique are that you try to explain a complicated topic in simplified terms, allowing you to better understand the complex topic. Pretty simple right? I thought so. The only problem is that my grades went down when I first started using it, and my time spent studying went up; what was I doing wrong?

Who am I:

My name is Zach. I‚Äôm a fourth-year medical student in Philadelphia. I make videos about medical school, studying, and growth. I love trying new things and often mess up. However, every time I screw up I usually learn something. Whatever I learn I post it either on YouTube or on my website üåê  (https://zhighley.com/‚Äã‚Äã).

I write a weekly newsletter üíå (https://zhighley.com/newsletter/‚Äã‚Äã) linking the best things I read, watched, and listened to that week. Join the 2,700+ that read it every Sunday morning.

My latest project is a low-profile mechanical keyboard, with three clickable displays, CircuitPython firmware, and a fully custom PCB that snaps into an ergonomic split board or a standalone number pad. Hacker types will love how easy it is to make. Keyboard nerds will hate pretty much everything; this build is a plump, aromatic Cleveland steamer all over the mech keeb orthodoxy.

This will eventually be a product! For now, you can download the files and snoop around at https://github.com/zackfreedman/mirage. It's not ready for you to make, but it's close.

Plouffe is here with the Angry Miao AM AFA keyboard, which is designed to look similar to the Macross VF-19 jet. This interesting design also comes with a world's first -- a 3-way adjustable leaf spring! Does this give the user unprecedented control over their typing feel, or does it leave the keyboard feeling mushier than a cheap laptop?

CYBERPUNK 2077 2.0 includes:
New Police System
Vehicle Combat

Combat AI Enhancements
New Radio Stations

PERKS: A complete Perk tree overhaul. These trees now contain fewer perks, but impact gameplay in a more meaningful way. 

CYBERWARE
Armor is now provided primarily by cyberware. As a result, clothing's purpose is mostly cosmetic. Clothing items no longer have mod slots, and only some items provide bonuses.

WEAPONS
Changed the unique effects of some Iconic weapons to better reflect their distinctive features.
The ""first equip"" animation can now be triggered at any time.

& MUCH MORE

Cyberpunk 2077 is an open-world, action-adventure story set in Night City, a megalopolis obsessed with power, glamour and body modification. You play as V, a mercenary outlaw going after a one-of-a-kind implant that is the key to immortality..

The mindmap is a surprisingly technical skill which tells a lot about a student's cognitive process. For myself and my more experienced academic coaches, we can look at a mindmap and in about 10-20 seconds, have a really solid grasp of this person's level of deep processing and critical thinking.

Mindmaps done wrong are a waste of time. Many people have tried and found it to be ineffective.

In the thousands of students I've worked with, I have never seen a student who did a mindmap with the correct technique who still found it ineffective.

In this video, I introduce a few principles of good mindmapping that when COMBINED with the correct overall study system can produce some incredible effects!

All with the handy mnemonic - GRINDE......

Lyrics:
Intro: 
Fra-fractions of infinity

Verse 1
When‚Äôs the last time you let yourself think?
I might be gone every time I let myself blink
I wouldn‚Äôt say I was surprised
On the 82nd time
When‚Äôs the last time your love was unrequited? 
I know I showed up to the party uninvited
It‚Äôs getting hard for me to hide (show me how you‚Äôll sentence me)
Running out the light (divided divinity)

Chorus:
Tell me,
You think it‚Äôs all in your head
You might be already dead
It‚Äôs funny when you think about it all again

Verse 2:
Been afraid of nothing for so long
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm stuck with it
But nothing is gonna change
Until I change what nothing is 
And it‚Äôs‚Ä¶
Fractions of infinity
Fractions of infinity
Show me how you‚Äôll sentence me
Divided divinity

Chorus 2:
Tell me,
You think it‚Äôs all in your head
You might be already dead
It‚Äôs funny when you think about it all again‚Ä¶

Bridge verse:
Every time I miss you,
I hear a voice without a face
And every time I‚Äôm with you,
The clock hands wave me out of place
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice
I see my life inside your hands
Walls cave in when you start to pray
I‚Äôve seen all I‚Äôll ever understand
Wouldn‚Äôt make sense in another way
I think I hit my target weight,
got exorcized (exercise) while I stood in place
Got every time that I couldn‚Äôt trace
Got restless eyes, they don‚Äôt look away
It emphasized that I shouldn‚Äôt stay, okay okay
Based on what?
Rippin up projector screens, the director screamin cut
Based on what?
Take 23 let‚Äôs get this scene and then it‚Äôll be enough
Right?
Throw some grain on if you can and that is that
I‚Äôm in that space between your hands about to clap,
Those walls are caving in and they say congratulations that‚Äôs a wrap.

Chorus 3:
Tell me,
You think it‚Äôs all in your head
You might be already dead
It‚Äôs funny when you think about it all again‚Ä¶


Outro:
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice 
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice

Those words don‚Äôt do you justice 
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice
(fractions of infinity)
Those words don‚Äôt do you justice 
(show me how you‚Äôll sentence me)"

The steps shown here apply to both the low profile Choc and MX variants for the Corne. The board uses Choc White switches which feel pretty good although I still prefer Choc Robins for clicky switches. This board also uses Nice View displays which use very low power draw making them perfect for a wireless build. 

The board shown in this video was provided by Typeractive, run by Nick, the creator of the Nice Nano wireless controller. I highly recommend if you decide to build a wireless Corne, get it from Typeractive. They have a really nice 3D configurator that gives you a real-time preview of what parts you'll be getting and makes ordering everything a breeze. You can find the board over on their website: https://typeractive.xyz

Frans Elsen was a very important Dutch pianist, arranger and educator of Jazz. He and Barry shared a mutual appreciation of each others music and were close friends. This material has been edited and selected by Frans himself. It gives a unique insight in Barry's wonderful ways of teaching and his extraordinary musicianship.

Animal Crossing: City Folk, known in Japan as Animal Forest: Let's Go to Town (Ë°ó„Å∏„ÅÑ„Åì„ÅÜ„Çà„ÄÄ„Å©„ÅÜ„Å∂„Å§„ÅÆÊ£Æ Machi e Ik≈ç yo D≈çbutsu No Mori?), in South Korea under a similar title as Animal Forest: Let's Visit the Town (ÌÉÄÏö¥ÏúºÎ°ú ÎÜÄÎü¨Í∞ÄÏöî ÎèôÎ¨ºÏùò Ïà≤, Tauneuro Nolleogayo Dongmul-ui Sup) and Animal Crossing: Let's Go to the City in Europe, Australia and other PAL regions. Animal Crossing: City Folk is a video game title in the Animal Crossing series. It is a life simulation relaxing game where the player lives with animals and make it's own life.

City Folk takes advantage of the WiiConnect24 functionality of the Wii console. It also uses a new feature called Wii Speak, which allows players to talk to each other when visiting each other's towns.

There are now 64 insects and fish which is an increase of 8 since Wild World, which had 56 insects and fish.

This incarnation of the Animal Crossing series features a newly accessible location called the City. The City houses most of the characters that, in previous games, were considered special visitors. These include Gracie the Giraffe and Redd the Fox, among other characters such as Dr. Shrunk and Lyle. This area of the game is available via Kapp'n's bus, and is open all hours of the day. Most of the shops close at 9 PM daily, with the exception of Redd's Store and The Resetti Surveillance Center.

The City Plaza also features new characters Phineas the sea lion and Kicks the skunk. Lyle now works in the Happy Room Academy and Shrunk now works at the Marquee next door. The player can now find Gracie in her store, GracieGrace, who is managed by the new character Labelle.

NEW HERE?
Hi, I‚Äôm Stephen Cabral, Board Certified Doctor of Naturopathy and Integrative Health Practitioner.

For years I struggled with trying to figure out how to overcome multiple life-alternating illnesses such as auto-immune, Addisons, type 2 diabetes, digestive, allergies, insomnia, and debilitating fatigue.  

Then I discovered a mentor who taught me how to combine and integrate multiple health practices into one. From there I tested these theories by traveling all around the world and discovering how to finally help people rebalance their bodies and live the life they always wanted. 

I‚Äôm happy to say that after being shown the way and now creating my own proven protocols based on combining the best of ancient Ayurvedic wisdom with state-of-the-art Functional Medicine my team and I have completed over 250,000 appointments helping people just like you and I.

If you‚Äôre interested in getting well, losing weight, or living longer stronger, I look forward to helping you to accomplish those goals. Be well and please always reach out if you have any questions or if my team and I can be of service!

I studied Math and Operations Research at Columbia University. This is my first video on this channel. (Exciting!) In this video, I talk about why math can be very difficult and seem nonsensical at times. I share the system that I use to practice math problems in an enjoyable and effective way, and I explain how you can do the same. I understand that math can become very challenging when you don't find studying it enjoyable, so I hope this video can be motivating and helpful if you're currently struggling with math.

üçÄ Good morning friends ^^
üéÄ I really enjoy the tunes of jazz piano music and hot cups of coffee next to it. In the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, we often miss this. So my hobby is creating videos that help you study, improve your mood, relax and sleep easily.
üåπ It took me 8 hours to be able to create the videos of the cozy book cafe environment (all original artwork, images, sound mix) to ensure the highest quality video and the most creative I can do. It's my work of love and if you like my work and art, please consider supporting in one of the following ways: üëá

I've been working on this for over 6 months now and thought it's cool enough that other's might be interested in learning about it. Absolutely everything I talk about here is completely open source and freely available in these public repositories:

Computerraria (World file and support software): https://github.com/misprit7/computerraria
WireHead (Accelerator mod): https://github.com/misprit7/WireHead

To download the mod to try it, here is the steam workshop link, although for any development I'd recommend using the Github link instead:
WireHead: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2946369856

If you're interested in learning more about the more technical engineering side of things, definitely let me know in the comments. I would be happy to go into it but I'm not really sure there's an audience for it.

Big thanks to Gus for implementing the raycaster engine, still can't believe that works so well. Eric, Renu and Evan also deserve credit for listening to me ramble for countless hours about various different wiring schemes and optimizations.

My family teaches you how to speak Baltimorese,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa3Tl3t88Mc,Phil Schwarzmann,Comedy,[''],2023-09-27T00:55:04.710Z,"Let my family, at Christmas Day dinner, teach you how to speak Baltimorese (Bawlmerese).  How many of these words can you say correctly?
http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/baltimore-insider-blog/bs-fe-bawlamerese-20171228-story.html

As seen in the Baltimore Sun

======

How do you say ‚ÄúDown the ocean?‚Äù

All the time he was growing up in Baltimore County, Phillip Schwarzmann never knew he spoke funny.

‚ÄúPeople say I speak with an accent, but I say I‚Äôm just speaking perfectly normal,‚Äù he says.

Well, Bawlamerese does sound funny to people who have never heard it before, who insist that there‚Äôs no such phrase as ‚Äúdowny ocean‚Äù (which, of course, is how that phrase in the opening sentence above is supposed to be pronounced).

So Schwarzmann, now 38 and 17 years removed from living in Baltimore, decided to take advantage of returning home for the holidays. During a family get-together at his aunt‚Äôs home in Perry Hall, he had various family members pronounce words and phrases written on index cards ‚Äî from ‚ÄúTuesday‚Äù and ‚Äúwater‚Äù to ‚Äúambulance‚Äù and ‚ÄúBelair Rd.‚Äù ‚Äî committed their distinctive pronunciations to video and posted it to his Facebook page.

At the suggestion of a friend, he made the post public. By Thursday afternoon, more than 500,000 people had viewed it, Schwarzmann said. More than 4,200 people had liked it, and more than 11,000 had shared it.

‚ÄúI wanted to show my San Francisco friends why I talk so funny,‚Äù Schwarzmann, a UMBC grad now doing public relations work for a tech company, said Thursday, still in Baltimore and enjoying English the way it was meant to be spoken. ‚ÄúEspecially in the Bay area ‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt really have an accent. They always make fun of me, for certain words. Everybody has seen ‚ÄòThe Wire.‚Äô Every time I say certain words at work, I get grief.‚Äù

His family certainly seems to be in the spirit, happily talking about ‚ÄúBlair Road‚Äù and ‚Äúamblance‚Äù and ‚Äúworter‚Äù and ‚ÄúTuesdee.‚Äù Truly, it‚Äôs about time the rest of the world learned to speak properly.

‚ÄúI knew my family would be good at those words,‚Äù Schwarzmann says. ‚ÄúThey can be good spokespeople.‚Äù"

on a sunny day, i wake up
and the light drains in
and automatically, i reach out
and i feel the warm weight on my fingers
yellow with the strain, I guess, I let up
kick the rubble on the eightfold
i see myself am i dreaming again cos it feels like

all my life i've been so sure i'm alright

but sometimes i'm lonely
and the only things i care about
fall apart like macaroni
only for today

i let it fall away and come down
let it dress me up
and as it i knew it would, there's no doubt
just a troubadour tied to my mooring
staring at my chains again, they're cut off
but i won't get out
i see myself as a marionette, yeah it feels like

all my life i've been so sure i'm alright
banging my drum, blow the fife, circle the pain all night

but sometimes i'm lonely
and the stupid things i think about
call my name seems like i'm only
waiting for today

you can live your life this way, it's true
while the old folk pray for tomorrow i'm waiting for today

all my life i've been so sure i'm alright

The following comes from a mission statement that appeared in the inaugural issue of SPIN. It means as much to this current staff as it did to the original writers and editors.

A confession: SPIN is imperfect. It‚Äôs rough-edged, restless, insatiably curious. A little aggressive, a little cocky. Youthfully uncompromising, but maturely flexible. Romantic ‚Äî definitely! Irreverent ‚Äî sure! Unpredictable ‚Äî yes. Very alive.

Welcome to our Denzel Curry VENGEANCE ft. JPEGMAFIA, ZillaKami reaction!!! This is our latest video reaction from our new music reaction channel Beer‚Äôs & Bars. Here we listen, react, and breakdown bars while enjoying some of our favorite beers. Today we had the pleasure of vibing to another Denzel Curry VENGEANCE ft. JPEGMAFIA, ZillaKami!! We are convinced at this point that Denzel Curry is a true chameleon, and it becomes more evident as he provides a different delivery, prospective and sound for each of the tracks with heard so far! It also seems like Denzel is making his way around the rap scene as he enlisted JPEGMAFIA, ZillaKami to give their two cents which feels more like a Mil! Denzel is quickly becoming one of our favorites!! Make sure to Like, Comment and Subscribe for our reactions like this.

Prior to this song we took a detour to The Never Story to peep the first Lauder track and it was amazing and it now brings us to the conclusion with this amazing JID Lauder Too track!!!   This again was an incredible lyrical performance as JID really goes more in depth and displays a difficult demo of lyrical gymnastics!!! This Lauder Too song is 10x more explosive and the first Lauder is a jaw dropping song so that is saying something!! This Dirty South talent continues to have us at the edge of our seats wanting more. The Forever Story was a great journey, JID is a complete artist and we look forward to the next project!!

this vlog is a bit of a clipsmash from the past 6 months. got a new sit-stand desk from uplift and it turned into a whole office update, so you'll get a better look at the equipment i currently have in my workspace. ended up trying a bunch of new tech too- a wireless kensington orbit mouse, LG widescreen monitor, etc. i re-set up my cintiq for 3D character work and show the ergotron monitor arm i like to pair with it. nothing sponsored btw. some out-of-the-office clips from my travels too :) hope you enjoy. leave a comment on whatever pleases you. much love

Q) Why are there comments from days ago when this video has just gone live today?
A) Patrons https://www.patreon.com/techmoan usually have early access to videos. I'll show the first version of a video on Patreon and often the feedback I get results in a video going through further revisions to improve it.  e.g. Fix audio issues, clarify points, add extra footage or cut extraneous things out.

Since then, I always wondered if I could also build a handheld game console from scratch, downscaling all the components until I could make it portable enough for the hands. This project moved fast and was finished long time ago, but I had a lot of setbacks. The camera I was using suddenly broke and I couldn't finish the last scenes until very recently.

Cassette Beasts might go down as the best indie game this year, and even might end up being my personal game of the year. It came out right before Tears of the Kingdom and around the same time as Xenoblade Future Redeemed so it totally flew under my radar, but luckily after a few people recommended it to me, I was able to give this wonderful game a shot, and you should too!

I guess this video is kind of a Cassette Beasts Review but I kinda think of it as more of a showcase? idk, it's not critical enough to be a proper *review* but I guess it depends on who you ask. Some people say this game is like Pokemon and I guess fundamentally it is, but that's where the similarities stop. They're both monster catching games, but that's about it."

1 week no computer mouse challenge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WSURNHhN6c,Tantan,Science & Technology,"['challenge', 'programming', 'no mouse', '1 week', 'computer mouse', 'programmer', 'gamedev', 'vim']",2023-09-25T03:17:36.668Z,"can I survive 1 week without a computer mouse? Will a keyboard and a midi controller be enough to use my computer for doing my work, programming, documentation browsing, video watching etc...

Every year I dedicate a week or two in evaluating the tools I use.
Is there something I can optimize, something that needs refreshment?

The vim text editor / editing method is what has led me to try live without the mouse. I use it for programming, web browsing, to some extent window management since PopOs has a vim like layout.

If you connect to the working board of the tablet usb splitter, usb-network converter (ethernet), 4.2V power supply and several other modules, then the board will turn out almost a full-fledged android computer, as it has the ability to connect a mouse, keyboard usb flash drive and even a portable hard drive. 
Given the large number of free office applications, games and a variety of programs, for the undemanding user such a console can replace a personal computer.
Think about it, maybe such an idea will appeal to your liking and even more so on your pocket!
And if you are a demanding PC user and use special programs and games, this idea may interest you to create a Android set-top box for your TV.
If you are interested in how I made such a case, write about it in the comments and I will make a separate video about it.

Recently I found an old monitor on my shelf and thought, ""What can be made out of it?  The answer came instantly - a TV and more....
The costs for such a TV will not exceed 20 - 30 $!  True, the diagonal is small, but if you need a small TV, then it is quite a decent solution.
If you watch this video to the end, you should have no questions about how to do it! Watch, analyze, and choose the types and standards of television that are right for you. I hope this video will be useful to you!

You people make me sick. I mean, I was already sick, but you made me angry too. Your shrill shrieking about my ""lopsided"" wearable computer reached a boiling point, and in placating your fixation with right angles, I revisited what is arguably my very first project. Turns out I'm better at 3D printing, Fusion 360, and Google Glass ergonomics after 12 years of practice. I didn't see that coming.

And give it a rest with the ""OCD"". Obsessive-compulsive disorder isn't getting triggered by a pair of glasses being two degrees off on the Y axis. It's counting the number of Cheerios in your bowl because if it's not a multiple of 7, the International Space Station will deorbit and flatten your mother. If you think you have actual OCD, talk to a specialist - OCD has highly effective drug-free treatments you can learn to perform yourself.

In this episode, you'll learn how to make a mechanical keyboard start to finish, and how to choose everything that goes into it. I explain which keyswitches to use, how to figure out which layout is right for you, and what software to prepare. I finish by building a 3D printed 60% mechanical keyboard start to finish, and things only get a little lewd.

My build is a SiCK-68 60% mechanical keyboard, with Kailh Box Jade keyswitches, Costar stabilizers, and questionable keycaps from Amazon. I didn't show the USB cable, but it's a pink paracord-wrapped mini USB dealio from 1UP.

Breaking PDF Encryption and PDF Signatures

PDF is the most widely used standard for office documents. Supported by many desktop applications, email gateways and web services solutions, are used in all sectors, including government, business and private fields. For protecting sensitive information, PDFs can be encrypted and digitally signed. Assumed to be secure for 15 years, our talk reveals how to break PDF Encryption and how to break PDF Signatures. We elaborated novel attacks leading to critical vulnerabilities in all PDF viewers, most notably in Adobe, Foxit, and Okular. As a result, an attacker can retrieve the plaintext of encrypted PDFs without knowing the password and manipulate the content of digitally signed PDFs arbitrarily while a victim is unable to detect this.

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is the de-facto standard for document exchange worldwide. It is used to store sensitive information like contracts and health records. To protect this information PDF documents can be encrypted or digitally signed. Thus, confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation can be achieved. In our research, we show that none of the PDF viewers achieve all of these goals by allowing an attacker to read encrypted content without the password or to stealthily modify the signed content. 

We analyze the PDF encryption specification and show two novel techniques for breaking the confidentiality of encrypted documents. First, we abuse the PDF feature of partially encrypted documents to wrap the encrypted part of the document within attacker-controlled content and therefore, exfiltrate the plaintext once the document is opened by a legitimate user. Second, we abuse a flaw in the PDF encryption specification to arbitrarily manipulate encrypted content. The only requirement is that a single block of known plaintext is needed, and we show that this is fulfilled by design. Our attacks allow the recovery of the entire plaintext of encrypted documents by using exfiltration channels which are based on standard compliant PDF properties. 

In addition, we present the first comprehensive security evaluation on digital signatures in PDFs. We introduce three novel attack classes which bypass the cryptographic protection of digitally signed PDF files allowing an attacker to spoof the content of a signed PDF. We analyzed 22 different PDF viewers and found 21 of them to be vulnerable, including prominent and widely used applications such as Adobe Reader DC and Foxit. We additionally evaluated eight online validation services and found six to be vulnerable.  

All findings have been responsibly disclosed, and the affected vendors were supported during fixing the issues. Our research on PDF security is also available online at https://www.pdf-insecurity.org/.

I was told over and over again as a kid that you can't make money as an artist (again, not true) and that discouragement prevented me from pursuing art seriously until after I'd graduated from college with a degree I wouldn't end up using. 

I've been pursuing an art career ever since, slowly building up my income streams and beginning to make money. It absolutely takes work and patience and a hefty dose of luck but it's absolutely achievable-- artists do not have to starve. In fact, the variety of income streams available to creatives is unlike any other career.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed by CD Projekt Red and published by CD Projekt, based on video game designer Mike Pondsmith's game series. Set in a dystopian Cyberpunk universe, the player assumes the role of ""V"" (played by Gavin Drea/Cherami Leigh), a mercenary in the fictional Californian city known as ""Night City"", where they deal with the fallout from a heist gone wrong that results in an experimental cybernetic ""bio-chip"" containing an engram of the legendary rock star and terrorist Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) threatening to slowly overwrite V's mind; as the story progresses V and Johnny must work together to find a way to be separated and save V's life.

The game's development began following the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt ‚Äì Blood and Wine (2016). The game was developed by a team of around 500 people using the REDengine 4 game engine. CD Projekt launched a new division in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, and partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC, and Jali Research to aid the production. Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith was a consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves had a starring role. The original score was led by Marcin Przyby≈Çowicz, and featured the contributions of several licensed artists. After years of anticipation, CD Projekt released Cyberpunk 2077 for PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One on 10 December 2020, followed by PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 15 February 2022.

Cyberpunk 2077 received praise from critics for its narrative, setting, and graphics. However, some of its gameplay elements received mixed responses while its themes and representation of transgender characters received some criticism. It was also widely criticized for bugs, particularly in the console versions which suffered from performance problems. Sony removed it from the PlayStation Store from December 2020 to June 2021 while CD Projekt rectified some of the problems. CD Projekt became subject to investigations and class-action lawsuits for their perceived attempts at downplaying the severity of the technical problems before release; these were ultimately cleared with a settlement of US$1.85 million. By September 2022, the game has sold more than 20 million copies. An expansion, Phantom Liberty, is set to release on 26 September 2023 on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A sequel was announced.

Corrections:
- [Visual error at 6:02] ""Ultrecht"" should be Utrecht
 - [Visual error at 10:32] Shortest path from A to C should be ADC, yielding a distance of 1+7=8, making the total distance from A to C to E: 8+12=20

Footnotes:
 - Other prominent online judges similar to Codeforces/DMOJ include AtCoder, Leetcode (mostly technical interview-type questions), Codechef, and TopCoder. CSES is an online judge focused on a single problemset. Advent of Code is a Christmas-themed daily programming challenge run annually in December in which only the output of the test cases has to be submitted as opposed to the solution code. Google Foobar is a ""secret"" Google programming challenge meant to be a recruiting technique targeted towards Google Search users who use keywords related to coding.
 - The technical term for a ""network of nodes"" is a ""graph"". Algorithms dealing with such graphs are categorised as graph theory algorithms. Nodes are connected by ""edges"" which may or may not have ""weights"". A directed graph is a graph in which the edges only go one way. An acyclic graph is a graph which contains no cycles.
 - A queue is different from a list in that it is not indexable, but rather just serves the element at the top when polled. A priority queue serves the element with the highest priority (usually implemented with heap). It does not actually ""sort itself"" but the elements will come out ""sorted"". The queue is sometimes referred to as ""a list"" in this video. This is meant to mean a ""sequence of elements"" and not the ""list"" data structure that exists in some languages.
 - The preferred language for most competitive programming is C++, though other languages are also used. Java, for example, is often used alongside a rewrite of the input reader class, as the built-in Scanner is too slow.

The steps shown here apply to both the low profile Choc and MX variants for the Corne. The board uses Choc White switches which feel pretty good although I still prefer Choc Robins for clicky switches. This board also uses Nice View displays which use very low power draw making them perfect for a wireless build. 

The board shown in this video was provided by Typeractive, run by Nick, the creator of the Nice Nano wireless controller. I highly recommend if you decide to build a wireless Corne, get it from Typeractive. They have a really nice 3D configurator that gives you a real-time preview of what parts you'll be getting and makes ordering everything a breeze. You can find the board over on their website: https://typeractive.xyz

Michael Cera stars as the titular character as well as Chris Evans, Kieran Culkin, Marie Elizabeth Winstead, Anna Kendrick, Brie Larson and a bunch of other stars.

[Intro]
I don‚Äôt wanna ask but

[Chorus]
Hey, what‚Äôs your name?
I‚Äôm feelin‚Äô undecided but
Who am I to blame
When lover girls end up with rust
Wait a minute
Is this even worth my minute?

You‚Äôre cute though
For sure
So here we go
Gonna hope you don‚Äôt ghost
You‚Äôre cute though
For sure
So here we go
Wait a minute
Is this even worth my minute?
Nah nah

[Verse 1]
Gave you all a try
I know how it ends each time
You go find another girl to treat like you had never
But it‚Äôs just for show
Say that she‚Äôs hot, feelings are locked
Nothin‚Äô to budge yeah yeah
Call her a lot, text her a spot
That‚Äôs where I was yeah yeah yeah 
Don‚Äôt wanna go through it again
But I can‚Äôt help it

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna feel love
Like the ones that stories write
Hidden in the spotlight
Shinnin' like no one
I don‚Äôt wanna ask but

[Chorus]
Hey, what‚Äôs your name?
I‚Äôm feelin‚Äô undecided but
Who am I to blame
When lover girls end up with rust
Wait a minute
Is this even worth my minute?
Nah nah
Wait a minute
I am almost at my limit

You‚Äôre cute though
For sure
So here we go
Gonna hope you don‚Äôt ghost

About Me

I'm a lawyer, part-time YouTuber, son, brother, startup founder, fianc√©, black coffee drinker and plant dad. I graduated from Cambridge University (where I studied French and Spanish), topped my law school class and now work for a corporate law firm in London as a trainee solicitor (which takes up a lot of my time)!

Around that, I'm a big fan of discovering new ways of thinking, of balancing work with life, and of performing to the very best of my ability. Ohh, and being happy. And I try to share all that on this YouTube channel üòÄ

Fun fact: I believe we massively overplay the role of ‚Äúnatural talent‚Äù üòÆ AND‚Ä¶ I also believe that TOGETHER, WE ARE ALL CAPABLE OF POSITIVITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND SUCCESS.

hopefully this was an informative video! I know it's a lot of just me sitting and talking, but I tried to keep it as concise and informative as possible. This video on my college side hustle / college remote part time job was originally 40 minutes long, but I ended up clipping it to a shorter version (ish). I also didn't end up keeping the part where I talk about my savings / investments and my overall strategy for that in this video (didn't think it was super relevant) -- so let me know if this would be something you're interested in! 

Also @The Graham Stephan Show because my life's goal is to be featured on his show either through this or a ""how much I spend in a week as a college student"", which ‚Äî yes ‚Äî I am going to film SOLELY for the SLIGHTEST chance the 20 cent Iced Coffee man himself might grace his eyes on my video

Dactyl ManuForm Mini Keyboard Build,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0F8Mig40m0,infiniteoffset,Science & Technology,[''],2023-09-22T12:31:43.859Z,"In this video I show build montage of Dactyl Mini Manuform. This is my first experience building this 3D printed ergonomic keyboard. The video is a bit low-key with not many details, but I hope you will still enjoy it. Also the parts I have used were budget, because I did not want to mess with more premium stuff yet. It's not the last Dactyl that I will be building, so I will probably make more detailed videos later. I have downloaded this model from thingiverse, but later I hope to learn how to generate my own model.

About Me

I'm a lawyer, part-time YouTuber, son, brother, startup founder, fianc√©, black coffee drinker and plant dad. I graduated from Cambridge University (where I studied French and Spanish), topped my law school class and now work for a corporate law firm in London as a trainee solicitor (which takes up a lot of my time)!

Around that, I'm a big fan of discovering new ways of thinking, of balancing work with life, and of performing to the very best of my ability. Ohh, and being happy. And I try to share all that on this YouTube channel üòÄ

Fun fact: I believe we massively overplay the role of ‚Äúnatural talent‚Äù üòÆ AND‚Ä¶ I also believe that TOGETHER, WE ARE ALL CAPABLE OF POSITIVITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND SUCCESS.

REFERENCES

The article I showed in the video comparing elaborative encoding to retrieval practice is:

Karpicke, J. D., & Blunt, J. R.  (2011). Retrieval practice produces more learning than elaborative studying with concept mapping. Science, 331(6018), 772-775. bit.ly/3S5i9KP

Below, one of the classic pieces on retrieval. It's really an illustration of why you shouldn't just stop trying to remember something just because you have successfully recalled it in the past:

Karpicke, J. D., & Roediger III, H. L. (2008). The critical importance of retrieval for learning. science, 319(5865), 966-968. http://psychnet.wustl.edu/memory/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Karpicke-Roediger-2008_Sci.pdf

This is a meta-analysis on the testing effect, which I haven't read in-depth lately, but is worth checking out if you're into this stuff:

Rowland, C. A. (2014). The effect of testing versus restudy on retention: a meta-analytic review of the testing effect. Psychological bulletin, 140(6), 1432. https://bit.ly/3VwGpII

There's quite a bit of support for the idea that you want to be operating at a ""high level"" (e.g., synthesizing, applying, critiquing) early in the game. It's not like you need to learn all these rote facts first. A point that Justin makes eloquently in his video on encoding. The piece below is a great discussion of that.

Agarwal, P. K. (2019). Retrieval  practice & Bloom‚Äôs taxonomy: Do students need fact knowledge before  higher order learning?. Journal of Educational Psychology, 111(2), 189. https://bit.ly/3T5Va3r

Some have argued that retrieval is only good for simple materials (like remembering new vocabulary words) and not complex materials (like understanding how Newtonian physics works). Although many of the early studies do focus on ""simple"" materials, there's plenty of studies that establish the effect of retrieval is just as strong for complex materials.

Karpicke, J. D., & Aue, W. R. (2015). The testing effect is alive and well with complex materials. Educational Psychology Review, 27(2), 317-326. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-015-9309-3"

How to Fix ‚ÄòDevice Requires Further Installation‚Äô on Windows 10 [Tutorial],https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CigPHga_HFg,MDTechVideos,Science & Technology,"['dell', 'hp', 'acer', 'asus', 'toshiba', 'lenovo', 'tablet', 'laptop', 'device pci requires further installation', 'device requires', 'device requires further installation', '2020', 'in 2020']",2023-09-21T11:15:13.496Z,"How to Fix ‚ÄòDevice Requires Further Installation‚Äô on Windows 10 [Tutorial]

Several Windows users have been reporting that upon investigating Device Manager, they found one or multiple devices (PCI, USB, Audio, etc.) that have an Event Log stating that they ‚Äòrequire further installation‚Äò. Although affected users report that this scenario doesn‚Äôt limit the device‚Äôs functionality in an apparent way, they would still like to know what they have to do in order to remove the error message. In the vast majority of cases, the issue is reported to occur on Windows 10.

In case you encounter the error Device requires further installation while trying to connect an external device to your system, then this tutorial may be helpful for you. Usually, external devices like USB sticks, headphones, speakers, etc. auto-install drivers when you connect them toyouPC. This means that the drivers are downloaded and installed into the system as soon as you connect it to your system. However, in case the driver is corrupt or outdated, you could encounter the error in the discussion. The other causes for the issue could be pending updates, checking the wrong event and an incorrect version of the Intel PROSet Wireless driver.

Device requires further installation

Before proceeding with any other solution, make sure Windows is updated to the latest version. Also, remember to verify that you are checking the correct event on the event viewer. After that, you could proceed to the following solutions to resolve the issue:

Manually update the drivers of the device to the latest version
Install the latest version of the Intel PROSet Wireless driver on Intel systems.

Update the drivers of the device to the latest version

The primary cause of the error ‚ÄúDevice requires further installation‚Äù is that the drivers of the external device could be corrupt or outdated. This is more common with devices like printers and scanners for which the drivers are via external media provided with them.

In this case, you can download the drivers from the manufacturer‚Äôs website and install then into your system while keeping the device in question connection.

It should be noted that if you have pre-installed drivers in your system, especially for printers and scanners, you would have to remove the older drivers before installing the new ones. Else, the two drivers would interfere with each other.

It would best to download the driver from the manufacturer‚Äôs website, uninstall your existing driver, and fresh install it.

We investigated this particular issue by analyzing various user reports and testing out the different repair strategies that most affected users have successfully used to get this message to disappear from the Event Log of the device in question.

This tutorial will apply for computers, laptops, desktops,and tablets running the Windows 10 operating system (Home, Professional, Enterprise, Education) from all supported hardware manufactures, like Dell, HP, Acer, Asus, Toshiba,Lenovo, and Samsung)."

In this episode, you'll learn how to make a mechanical keyboard start to finish, and how to choose everything that goes into it. I explain which keyswitches to use, how to figure out which layout is right for you, and what software to prepare. I finish by building a 3D printed 60% mechanical keyboard start to finish, and things only get a little lewd.

My build is a SiCK-68 60% mechanical keyboard, with Kailh Box Jade keyswitches, Costar stabilizers, and questionable keycaps from Amazon. I didn't show the USB cable, but it's a pink paracord-wrapped mini USB dealio from 1UP.

In this video I go over the process of designing and building a DIY Space Mouse using a 3 axis magnetometer and the RP2040. This device is made for Fusion360 but can be adapted to other CAD applications. Current features: Orbit, Pan, Home view, Fit to view. I also go over workaround for setting up a keyboard shortcut for the Home View using a custom Add-in in Fusion 360, as it's not natively supported right now.

In case when your laptop freezes because of lack of memory, you need to upgrade RAM. Sometimes you can just add some more RAM cards to free slot, and sometimes you need to replace RAM card, when there is no free slots for new. But in any case you need RAM card same type that is installed to you laptop: it's always SO-DIMM (laptop type of memory) and other characteristics depends on your laptop and RAM installed in it. In any case, I will place links to most likely RAM cards that must fit to your laptop in description and in 1st comment of this video.

Ok before you burn me alive, yes the best gaming monitor available on the market under 42‚Äù right now is in fact an Ultrawide, but it actually has nothing to do with it being an ultrawide.

It‚Äôs great because it‚Äôs OLED, I don‚Äôt have to squint to see it, nobody took a belt sander to it, and it has a good refresh rate of 175Hz. 

And if your a monster that looks at monitors all day like me you probably know I‚Äôm talking about the Alienware AW3423DW QD OLED, but I digress, what we're really here to talk about is the fact that, well, Ultrawide still kind of blows cheeks.

Wait wait wait wait wait

Before you pull out the pitchforks let me explain myself. I actually do like Ultrawide in terms of it looks very immersive, and it‚Äôs a bit closer to how are vision actually is, but just like that one neighbor's kid it has some serious issues, so unfortunately we‚Äôre gonna have to put it down and here they are 

Ultrawide is not good for doing work. I know I know it sounds insane, but trust me when you're trying to record your screen or even use certain programs it can be an absolute mess and for me it‚Äôs actually nearly unusable. Despite how cool Ultrawide is and that it allows you to fit more stuff on screen, it doesn‚Äôt always work how you‚Äôd want, and when every application has been designed for 16:9 trust me your absolutely going to run into some issues, it just depends on what you do for whether or not it‚Äôs a deal breaker.

Not many games actually support Ultrawide. I hear people say all the time that nearly all games support Ultrawide now, but that‚Äôs misleading at best, because sure they will run on an ultrawide and not have black bars, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it will look good. In my experience the majority of games today still don‚Äôt properly support Ultrawide and when you look towards the edges of the screen you‚Äôll see some really nasty stretching that‚Äôs not only distracting, but also makes you worse at the game, and the only way to reduce it is to turn your FOV way down, and even then it doesn‚Äôt always solve the issue.

Ultrawide is bad for competitive gaming. Yes you can definitely get used to it and play well on an ultrawide, but like going to work in just a thong it can be uncomfortable, and everyone can see your hairy a**cheeks. I mean there‚Äôs a reason you don‚Äôt see a single professional gamer using an ultrawide, and I think it mainly has to do with lack of proper support as well as the extra distraction from such a wide FOV.

So is Ultrawide cool? Yes absolutely, and it‚Äôs great for a lot of single player games, but the reality is it‚Äôs not the standard, and that‚Äôs gonna cause a lot of little issues because developers can barely be bothered to ship a working game let alone optimize it for niche resolutions these days, so when I see Ultrawide monitors I always think did I leave the laundry in the washer overnight again, and who‚Äôs ultra and why is he so wide?

And ultimately that‚Äôs why I think most people shouldn‚Äôt buy an Ultrawide monitor if there‚Äôs a similar 16:9 option available, but in the case of some gems like the AW3423DW it could be worth it.

[kenan] 

Man I really really wish I was iIlluminati
Niggas waiting on the peg like I‚Äôm dropping yahndi
Too black too strong, im a little thotty 
But fuck a big speech 
Cuz when I‚Äôm rolling 
I‚Äôm dressing up like I‚Äôm prince peach
And if you sending them Mario‚Äôs to defend me 
U better make sure they break all the Grammys 
kill all the winners losers and nominees 

Off probation 
Crackers hating 
Accusations
Only on occasions 
I don‚Äôt want relations 
Had some thotty phases
Strip home invasion 
Fuck with me man
Y‚Äôall better miss me
Cuz if you rolling 
I‚Äôm stoning niggas like rich Keith 
And when I‚Äôm whipping you niggas it‚Äôs not slavery
I‚Äôm on a mission to slaughter the completion
And leave them slumped on the downbeat 
Bitch work
Or how we gonna make this bullshit work ? 

How we gonna make this work?
How can I make a good beat? 
I get nervous when niggas want features

I get nervous 
I don‚Äôt know this 
I don‚Äôt know this

[kel]

Bitch I came back with jak and Dax off the shelf 
Shopping my target 
Im wishing you well 
I don‚Äôt think prayer can help 

This feel like kenan & kel 
These niggas broke like a dell 

Nigga tell 
Niggas melt 
I‚Äôma shoot 
You don‚Äôt sell
I don‚Äôt think prayers or poems or nothing can help

Welcome to our Denzel Curry VENGEANCE ft. JPEGMAFIA, ZillaKami reaction!!! This is our latest video reaction from our new music reaction channel Beer‚Äôs & Bars. Here we listen, react, and breakdown bars while enjoying some of our favorite beers. Today we had the pleasure of vibing to another Denzel Curry VENGEANCE ft. JPEGMAFIA, ZillaKami!! We are convinced at this point that Denzel Curry is a true chameleon, and it becomes more evident as he provides a different delivery, prospective and sound for each of the tracks with heard so far! It also seems like Denzel is making his way around the rap scene as he enlisted JPEGMAFIA, ZillaKami to give their two cents which feels more like a Mil! Denzel is quickly becoming one of our favorites!! Make sure to Like, Comment and Subscribe for our reactions like this.

On this video, I will show you how I achieved my dream desk setup 2023 and how I did a makeover to make it an aesthetic desk setup. :) I also did cable management to make the desk setup more pleasing.

I do really love neutral colors and white in interior design. It makes the space much brighter and peaceful. And of course, the trending, aesthetic vibe. ‚ú®

Aside from being aesthetic, all the item I bought are functional and really helped make me more efficient at work. Much comfortable too. :)

I'm really enjoying these my story driven pieces like Making Frankenstein's   Ã∂MÃ∂oÃ∂nÃ∂sÃ∂tÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂ Lamp, rather than the more 'talk at the camera' videos like This Floating Shelf Turns into a Desk. I also enjoy I made a table with a galaxy inside. My favorite ones include unique idea from old frying pan In case you were wondering this block of text is for SEO so you really don't need to read this. But yeah, got to mention my other stuff like create, four eyes, homemade modern, so my videos end up in the related section. OK BYE

Is This The Most Comfortable Way To Use The Moonlander Split Keyboard?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGQhiURh6Tw,Ben Vallack,Science & Technology,[''],2023-09-17T17:33:17.269Z,"The thing with split keyboards is it‚Äôs not always obvious what the most comfortable way to actually set them up is. The second part of this video also looks at an issue I discovered with custom keyboards that might be increasing fatigue so be sure to watch to the end!

Watch next: 
I Started Wearing My Keyboard! https://youtu.be/iOupyi-lQZM

Buy the iPad bean bag in the UK here: https://amzn.to/2O5aXU6

And the closest I can find for the US here: https://amzn.to/30firqb

In this video I look at how I‚Äôve been using my Moonlander recently as I think it might be the most comfortable way of using a split keyboard I‚Äôve found yet. 

What I‚Äôve found is that by using a bean bag as a rest you can create the perfect angle with your split keyboard using quite an aggressive tent position. This seems to me to be a very neutral position for your forearm angle and it‚Äôs surprising how little we see of people using this kind of tenting angle. 

It also allows for lots of adjustment in the rotation and front-to-back angle as well as the tenting itself. 

Of course the most significant part of tenting the Moonlander like this is that you can now set the thumb clusters exactly how you like, irrespective of the tent angle.

I also explore the changes I‚Äôve made to my 36 key layout which avoid the need to hold down the layer keys so much. This also has big impacts on the ergonomics of using keyboards. See the first version of my 36 key layout here: https://youtu.be/S0bBmcoVsm8

However, our dorm room doesn‚Äôt allow residents to put any holes in the wall. I am a huge Command Strip fan!  I have learned over the years that you must follow the directions and not rush the process (if you want them to hold). 

In this video I will share how I hung the pegboards using Command Strips. These pegboards make great dorm room decor and are very reasonably priced at IKEA. And there are so many accessories that fit into the board to hold all of those dorm room essentials.

See my blog post for photos and written instructions.

üì∫ Three things to note as you watch the video:

1. There was so much to fit in this video that I had to be pretty ruthless with avoiding getting bogged down in small details. You will need to spend some time reading the documentation for Ergogen to fill in the gaps. 

2. I mentioned battery connectors in the video. I have added the footprints for these to my fork of Ergogen and set them up in the latest config files (also in my repo) but I have yet to order a PCB that uses them. As such the boards you see in the video have the battery soldered directly to the board. I have a doubt as to whether the placement of my connectors on my boards will even allow the battery and connector to fit so please don‚Äôt just have my boards built without checking this is being prepared to just solder the battery directly. 

3. I glossed over the soldering in this video as I wanted to keep the scope fairly broad and wanted to leave time for looking at the shields, KiCad etc. When soldering the small switches I found I needed to drop the soldering iron temperature to stop burning the pads off the board. The technique for these surface mount parts is basically the same as I show in the video for the hotswap sockets: add solder to the pads, let it cool, then place the part on top of the solder and push the foot down onto it with the iron. 

‚ÄºÔ∏è Most important bit of all. When making these flippable boards the controller goes opposite on one side to the other.

Thanks for watching!
In this video, I showcase my experiences with using a split keyboard for a week to see whether the new layout would be worth switching to. Whether it be through extensive typing sessions, programming, or playing video-games, I shared my thoughts throughout the 7 days to showcase some of my initial thoughts, as well as personal benefits/downsides. Hopefully, this video can also help you in your decision on whether to purchase one as well! I personally have been continuing to use the keyboard, and have no plans on switching back (until new keyboards come, of course ;)).

Not gonna lie, my camera-work and lighting choices have stained the overall viewer experience, but I hope my ideas and review can still help you understand the experience of typing on a split keyboard a bit better.

[Intro]
I don‚Äôt wanna ask but

[Chorus]
Hey, what‚Äôs your name?
I‚Äôm feelin‚Äô undecided but
Who am I to blame
When lover girls end up with rust
Wait a minute
Is this even worth my minute?
Nah nah
Wait a minute
I am almost at my limit

[Post-Chorus]
You‚Äôre cute though
For sure
So here we go
Gonna hope you don‚Äôt ghost
You‚Äôre cute though
For sure
So here we go
Wait a minute
Is this even worth my minute?
Nah nah

[Verse 1]
Gave you all a try
I know how it ends each time
You go find another girl to treat like you had never
But it‚Äôs just for show
Say that she‚Äôs hot, feelings are locked
Nothin‚Äô to budge yeah yeah
Call her a lot, text her a spot
That‚Äôs where I was yeah yeah yeah 
Don‚Äôt wanna go through it again
But I can‚Äôt help it

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna feel love
Like the ones that stories write
Hidden in the spotlight
Shinnin' like no one
I don‚Äôt wanna ask but

[Chorus]
Hey, what‚Äôs your name?
I‚Äôm feelin‚Äô undecided but
Who am I to blame
When lover girls end up with rust
Wait a minute
Is this even worth my minute?
Nah nah
Wait a minute
I am almost at my limit

[Post-Chorus]
You‚Äôre cute though
For sure
So here we go
Gonna hope you don‚Äôt ghost
You‚Äôre cute though
For sure
So here we go

There's a smaller ""regular"" sized version of this phone, but the battery, screen and overall size isn't the same. There's a $83 difference, so if this one is too much, I would suggest to give that one a try! The size of the regular f22 would be similar to the Nokia 6300. I love bigger phones, so the pro is perfect for me!

The Boys are letting you in on their hilarious, high-energy (and often heartfelt) conversations. Topics range from exclusive stories to active player perspectives to out-of-left-field hot takes on things you and your friends only discuss behind closed doors. Sometimes they chat with a guest, sometimes it's just the two of them, but it's always a good time when you're Bussin' With The Boys.

And yes, this is the podcast where Mike Vrabel said he'd cut his piece off for a Super Bowl.

http://thirdworlds.net

TAKYON
Triple six, five, forked tongue
Subatomic penetration rapid fire through your skull
How I shot it on one taking it back to the days of trying to lose control
Swerving in a blaze of fire, raging through my bones
Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight, what its like to experience - Takyon

Out of the blue, in through the back
Door coming through like fuck what was that
Man I don't know, but it made me feel so heated 
How we creep without showing you jack
Shit from below, give a shit if you know
Cuz even if you did, you'd keep coming back
Back for more, need it man you're addicted to the heat
We make beats catch
Beat it til it bleeds to death, each track
Like EPMD snappin necks as we tap energy from everything on and off the map

Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight what its like to experience - Takyon

Takyon, shot down your throat like a keg of beer
Choke on the smoke we in and exhale til the whole chamber is clear
Haters act so fucking weird
Try to stain this atmosphere
But they can't cuz its way too sheer
How to make a hater disappear

Take shit where it ain't never been
Fuck what you thought could not comprehend
This shit if I fisted your brain with it
10-9-8-7-triple 6-5-forked tongue
Criminal level crunk lightning storm
Get out the way or get up torn
Ain't a picture big enough to fit
What we dig up from the core
Of all that they forgot ever was
Militant march of this war

Takyon - taking them down
All we see is blood
Takyon - turning them out
How to trick out and freak that buzz

Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight what its like to experience - Takyon

Lunar eclipse forcing you to trip
Off the moonlit fire we spray
Cryonic haunted bullets hollow tipped with toxic waste
So here's the deal, if you don't feel ill
Don't want it nowhere near my zone
That shit is dead, can't nobody get
With that shit gets dial toned

Takyon - bitch slappin pussy clots and clones
Takyon - settin off unibombs inside your dome

Oh shit I'm feeling it - Takyon
Hell yeah, fuck yeah I feel like killing it - Takyon
Alright that's tight what its like to experience - Takyon

BEWARE
I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship...

And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken
Past the point of no return.
Wage war like no tomorrow
Cuz no hell there won't be one
For all who deny the struggle
The triumphant overcome

Trips to where, few have been
Out of thin air, upon high winds
Rites begin when the sun descends
Have felt what few will ever know
Have seen the truth beneath the glow,
Of the ebb and flow, where roots of all mysteries grow
I am below, so far below
The bottom line
Transmitting live, transmissions rise
From the depths out of controlled by
Suspended glance of an unblinking eyes
Imminent gaze cast 'pon the path that winds
'Pon the path I find, and claim as mine
To ride the waves, of unrest
Made to make me shine as a testament
To why the ways of the blind will never get
Shit but shanked by my disrespect
Dismiss this life, worship death
Cold blood night of serpent's breath
Exhaled like spells from the endlessness
In the bottomless wells of emptiness
Channeled to invoke what we represent

Secret order
Elitist horde of
Creeping fire
Seizing power
Riders of the lupus hour
Eye on palm
Time is gone
Moonlight drawn
Fly til dawn
Sacrifice to rise beyond
Deep inside the violent calm
Of the coming storm
In blood sworn
To glorify and for life adorn
With all that dies to become unborn

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship...
I am the beast I worship

In the time before time eyes 'bove which horns
Curve like psychotropic scythes
And smell of torn flesh bled dry
By hell swarms of pestis flies
Vomiting forth flames lit by
An older than ancient force
That slays this life with no remorse

The spiral storm
Of flames inside
The torch I raise
The force I ride

Feel my vessel go up in flames
Flesh torch lit by thee unnamed
Direct connection to the source
Vestment of unnatural force
Forever burning black torch
Wisdom of the old and true
Possessed by the chosen few
Shining to reveal the ways
Of a darkness that pervades
All that is and ever was
Inferno of witches blood

Worship is not on bended knee
Nature knows not of mercy
To pray is to accept defeat
Power pisses on the weak
Bow and beheaded by the beast
Beggar on a bitches leash
Scum is desperate for relief
Worship is the way I ride
Witching currents through the eye
Of storms that force the false to die
Worship the flames with which I rise
Into apocalyptic skies

Harsh winds flay mine flesh to bone
In splintered skeleton I roam
Wastelands with not to call my own
But the path I walk alone
The hunger burns, within my gut
As my bones turn into dust

And I know soon come my time
For in mine void a pale horse burns
But I fear not the time I'm taken
Past the point of no return
Wage war like no tomorrow, know well there wont we one
For all who deny the struggle
The triumphant overcome ...

I close my eyes and seize it
I clench my fists and beat it
I light my torch and burn it
I am the beast I worship...
I am the beast I worship

http://thirdworlds.net

LORD OF THE GAME
Into the flame, into the fire
With no regard for a thing, fuck that I'm the lord of the game
I rule this empire

Lord of the game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
Cuz no one has came even close to the train
Of thought we drop like neutron bombs from the tower

Control this and bang this, then watch it rise higher
Than anything seen in your entire
Life spent in chains, sonic live wire
Electrified rain from the lips of the driver
Whippin the wheel
Flippin donuts to peel
Out on the face of the base, where's my lighter?
Need it to kill one more and chill while I feel
It so much my gut burns like the tires
Movin this movement of real shit inspired
By all that has come before this and was done
For the real ones packin real guns loaded with power
Shower the slums with power from the war marching drums that have come to devour
The weakness that runs when we come
Fuckin cowards

When they tell you you must make it
And you think hell no
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it
Hits so low

Lord of the game
Born to reign above all that you claim to know beyond a doubt
Cuz no one has came even close to the train of thought
We drop like neutron bombs from the tower
'Pon which we maintain
Like soldiers of fame
And fortune denied as to to get by without the
Bullshit coming at me from all sides
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Told me it was all good, but they lied
Don't wait to see whites of their eyes
Death to everyone who does not recognize
Wars never done, think it is you die

Where was I now
Like I said before
Hear someone knockin
At my front door
Who could it be, should I ignore
The knockin or see what could be in store
For me if I leave the safety of the shore
So many options, so little time
To do what I want 'fore the end of the line
Places its blade in the small of my spine
Is it paranoia, is it real?
How long can a man enjoy what he doesn't feel

When they ask if you can make it
And you don't wanna go

When they tell you you must make it
And you think hell no
Got a bad feeling and can't shake it
Hits so low

(Rather be stuck naked)
Than waste my time like the last time
And every time before that
Don't waste my time even one more time
When you know that shit is whack
Don't make me remind of you of the last time you
Said you'd never go back.

Fuck where you're from,
Fuck where you're goin,
It's all about where you're at

More about Gianmarco:
Gianmarco Soresi is a stand-up comedian, actor, and a little too much for some people. He‚Äôs told jokes on The Late Late Show with James Corden, Comedy Central, Netflix‚Äôs Bonding, Don‚Äôt Tell, The Real Housewives of New York for some reason, and he was a JFL New Face in 2022. He‚Äôs acted in Billy Crystal‚Äôs Here Today, Hustlers, The Last OG, and in his theater days shared the stage with some people who‚Äôve gone on to become huge real estate agents. You can see him post the kind of crowdwork clips that are arguably destroying the artform of stand-up comedy everywhere @gianmarcosoresi and he obviously has a podcast called The Downside with Gianmarco Soresi.üé§

In this video, I follow Dineth (a medical student at the University of New South Wales - UNSW Australia) for a campus tour of UNSW Sydney during the O-week festivities of 2023! We tour the places such as the library, med buildings and social areas as well as the main walkway of the UNSW campus and the surrounding suburbs!
Hope this can share some insight into what it will be like to study at UNSW if you are a prospective University student considering studying in New South Wales, Australia!

Look out for more uni and student life and study tips and tricks coming soon!

Dineth is my high school friend who is currently in his 3rd year studying medicine at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and he completed the HSC in 2017 with an ATAR of 99.95.
