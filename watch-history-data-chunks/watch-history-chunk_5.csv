Some bars are a little complicated, it's a cool arrangement:D
The guitar solo towards the end also has a fast triplet, which is difficult, but I had a lot of fun!

Who hid the veins and changed their hue
Who compromised the perfect view?
You oxidized the perfect blue
Dont let it out, Dont let it out
Dont say the words
Dont write them down
It gave you life and it stains your bed casings
Crumpled tissues on stacks of red pages
Close,
Close your eyes
Please dont leave me out in the cold
Leave me out to dry
Please dont leave me out in the middle of the night
Shake shake shaking to my core
I dont wanna see you any time in the future uh
Do shit just like we use to uh

Lyrics:

No, I don't miss the feeling anymore
Yeah, I want something new to love
I was so nostalgic,
but I'm fine without it
You don't really want what you think you want
No, I don't wanna lose it
this emotion
Yeah, I just wanna do everything
I get so excited
when I finally find it
It just gets brighter from now on

Then you sigh:
""You know I love you, so I think I should tell you, Porter,
this life: isn't it time that you grow up?""

(Chorus)
Oh, it's calling
I just can't stop, I'm sorry
I can feel a new day dawning
(I burn up, burn out -
I shouldn't do this to myself)

But sincerely,
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clearly
(I burn up, burn out -
I shouldn't do this to myself)

Well, this is why we do it,
for the feeling.
How do you do music?
Well, it's easy:
You just face your fears and
you become your heroes
I don't understand why you're freaking out

Then they say:
""Fine, well do what you need to
But I don‚Äôt want to see you
Wasting your life
Isn‚Äôt it time you get a job?""

(Chorus)
Oh, it's calling
I just can't stop, I'm sorry
I can feel a new day dawning
(I burn up, burn out -
I shouldn't do this to myself)

But sincerely,
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clearly
(I burn up, burn out -
I shouldn't do this to myself)

But sincerely,
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clearly,
and I know it doesn't last,
but I don't mind at all anymore

(Chorus)
Oh, it's calling
I just can't stop, I'm sorry
I can feel a new day dawning
(I burn up, burn out - 
I shouldn't do this to myself)

But sincerely,
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clearly
(I burn up, burn out -
I shouldn't do this to myself)

I was tasked with building a PC that could be carried onto an airplane! We took things a step further and set the goal of building a powerful gaming PC that fit into a backpack!

Lyrics:
Build me up
Build me up
Just so we go down again
Bring me down
Tear me apart
I don't mind it
I don't mind it

Giving up
Fuck the dream
It's better than this make-believe
Happiness
In smaller things
I can find it
I can find it

I'm moving away from the life of a maker
A far away future that I'd rather ensure
Awaits me through my introspection
I have found the right direction

Move along
Move along
Does it feel like home at all?
I'm away
From this world
Restart our life
I've made my choice

Museum opens its doors
Center piece, fearful of its curator
He sees perfection
In no need of his brush
The sculpture trembles
Afraid of its touch

See, it hurts. These things around me, I held them close, so close they shattered. The pieces carved into my skin a message, thanked me for their freedom. In silence, in solitude, which I used to love, I now tremble, because now, in silence and solitude, I only find my true self.

So I'm moving away from the life of a maker
A far away future that I'd rather ensure
Awaits me through my introspection
I have found the right direction

I got the idea for this video while playing around with a recreation of the Virtual Self/Porter track 'Ghost Voices'. After finding the soundfont I'm pretty sure porter used for this sound, I had the idea to try turn it into a wavetable inside Serum and create a preset using the LFO technique I covered in my Organic Synths tutorial. Long story short I was really happy with how it turned out and confirmed my theory that Soundfonts might be great source material for Serum presets.

For those of you not familiar with Soundfonts, they stem from a type of audio format created in the 90's utilising sample-based synthesis and were used commonly for video games. Soundfonts have a very identifiable sound character and although they can generally sound quite 'cheesy', when processed they can provide interesting results. Most importantly in this context they are generally quite short in duration as well as pitch corrected, making them ideal for the creation of custom wavetables in Serum.

There's a tonne of great and usually free soundfont packs out there if you do a quick google search. Once you have a bank you like you'll have to first extract the files before you can sample them:

Ableton: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bZk5FHSCUs
Logic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KwEVBkP5aA
Other (Soundfont VST Player): https://www.plogue.com/products/sforzando.html

Once you've extracted the soundfonts, you can bounce them out and turn them into a Serum wavetable using the same steps as my organic synth tutorial:

Step by Step guide:
1. Bounce a 1-2s sample of a single pitch (monophonic) Soundfont Try to avoid samples with pitch bend as Serum has a harder time dealing with them.
2. Drag and drop this sound onto a wavetable osc and select the constant framesize (pitch avg) option. An alternative is also to go into the wavetable editor and manually type the pitch of the sample you're importing. Sometimes if I didn't get the results I was hoping for I'd try different octaves (i.e c1, c2, c4)
3. Then you'll want to clean up the wavetable a bit. Delete unnecessary frames. Increase the grid size and click x-fade edges to smooth the wavetable from frame to frame. 
4. Drag and drop a ramp up LFO onto the WT position. Set to Env & Anchor modes. Lower the Hz to somewhere around 1-2 Hz. Experiment with different Hz settings until you find the sound is playing back at a similar speed to the original sample or at a speed that sounds good to you.
5. If all has worked nicely and you're happy with the result, save the wavetable for future use. If not, go back to step 2 and play around with inputting different octaves in the wavetable editor before importing. Sometimes this technique really is just trial and error and you might have to move on to trying different sounds instead.
6. From here it comes down to you as a sound designer to see what you can come up with. Play around with layering the new wavetable with the original sound, try different amounts of union, stack the sound with another oscillator with the same or different wavetable, try different filters and fx and play around with the amplitude envelope to shape the sound.

In this video, I teach you how to find the pitch of a sound using Audacity, how to make that sound into a soundfont using Polyphone, and how to test it and make music with it in Musescore 3. You can use these soundfonts to make custom music with custom sounds, YTPMVs, and Friday Night Funkin' mods!

Codeine got me in my feelings

I'm high now
Gotta go, gotta roll by the projects
Drop the pack, feed the hood, livin' lawless
Tax free, I'm that nigga livin' lawless
Hit Diego, NASCAR, get my ki's up
That's the plug, my amigo, Dr. Re-up
Switchin' twenties for the fifties, hundred K more
Switchin' fifties for the hundreds, that's the K.O.

Can't seem to find my face (Find my face)
They don't seem to know their place (Know their place,yeah wassup)
May he take my enemy (My enemy,Freebandz gang)
Let it sing amazing grace (We outta here)
(Super)

Came up out my city, blowed up
Pussy want smoke, roll up
Fuckin' on your bitch, throwed up
Drinkin' on the dirty soda
Promise I'ma never go sober (Yeah)
Niggas ain't nothin' but some vultures (Haha)
Percocets, molly, damn baby
Crushin' X on your punani
I done made love to an Ethiopian (I did)
I done put lean in her Fruitopia (Listen)

Fucked around, had to pour up one more (Drank)
Check my threads, I done went Herm√®s (Check me out)
I done went new baguettes, I done went VVS (Yeah, yeah)
Dirt in my cup and I'm cleanin' up fresh (Yeah, yeah)
Fuck her the best and she love me to death (Pluto)
But I love myself

Shit tryna take me, nigga (Nigga,yeah)
Blame it on the pills, my nigga (Nigga,Pluto)
Bitches bitchin' at me, ""Go slow"" (Slow)
But you ain't gon' see tomorrow ('Row)
Percocet pills, my nigga (Nigga)

Pop a Xan, gon' sip a Tech with it
Codeine got me in my feelings (Baby)

What's your choice of drug?
I be sippin' syrup, I think I'm in love, woah
From apartments to the top charts
Now it's sold-out shows
She say she play with her nose
I told her that's not in my goals
I know when to go
I know when to fold, that's never
They throwin' dirt with no shovel
It ain't no shame in my game
It ain't no flaw on my name
Only lay up in the rain
I made a promise, I bought her a Range
You can do that but don't go 'gainst the grain
Rolls-Royce umbrella (Woah)
Tall white thing lookin' like Cinderella
I be fuckin' with the mob, I know Goodfellas
Ain't fuckin' with the percs, but my man get 'em
And he got jiggas

Shit tryna take me, nigga (Nigga)
Blame it on the pills, my nigga (Nigga)
Bitches bitchin' at me, ""Go slow"" (Slow)

The most expensive paint color in the world,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y2QmAyw2u4,magnify,Entertainment,"['history time', 'fun facts', 'art supplies', 'color theory', 'painting']",2023-10-28T15:55:25.675Z,"Ultramarine, derived from the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli, is historically one of the most expensive pigments in the world.

Lapis lazuli, the stone from which ultramarine is extracted, has been used and revered since ancient times. It was mined in the Sar-i Sang mines of Afghanistan and traded to the far reaches of the ancient world, including Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley. Its deep blue hue made it a symbol of royalty and divinity.

Ultramarine is produced by grinding lapis lazuli into a powder. However, the process of extracting the purest blue pigment from the stone is intricate and labor-intensive. The stone has to be ground, washed, and then separated from its golden flecks of pyrite and calcite to get the richest blue. This painstaking process contributed to its high cost.  Due to its cost, ultramarine was often reserved for the most important parts of a painting, such as the robes of the Virgin Mary in Christian art. Artists would sometimes specify in their contracts that they were to use genuine ultramarine, underscoring the prestige associated with the pigment."

The Fastest Reader in the World ü§Ø,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vtp4XrJNtMs,magnify,Entertainment,"['fun facts', 'reading', 'literature', 'language', 'life hacks', 'Evelyn Wood']",2023-10-28T15:43:46.529Z,"Speed reading is a set of techniques that people use to read faster. There are many methods to do this, like ""chunking"" (grouping words together) and reducing the habit of silently sounding out words in your head (known as subvocalization). You might have come across books, online videos, apps, or even classes that claim to teach these techniques. But, just a heads up, there isn't much concrete scientific evidence that proves speed reading always works, so some experts are skeptical about it.

Evelyn Wood, a teacher from the 1950s, is credited with popularizing the term ""speed reading"". She wondered why some people read faster than others. One day, while sweeping her hand across a book page, she realized that her hand's movement helped guide her eyes faster across the text. She used this technique, taught it at the University of Utah, and later introduced it to the public."

If we have a train track with a slight curve, and we try to roll some basic wheels across it, we'll simply derail. Okay, you might say, it's an easy fix. You could just add a flange so it doesn't derail. And while the flange does keep it from derailing, it can't really navigate a turn.

üìú The Story: 
Unexpected thing happened when these bunch of gangsters booked most of the seats, and whenever someone entered the room, they would give them serious looks. Without a second thought, they would run away fearing for their lives. But what was really surprising, when this guy entered, they all seemed mad, but he didn‚Äôt react and moved closer to look for a seat. He calmly asked one of them to make a way, and sat there in silence while they kept staring at him. He seemed to have been through a lot and didn‚Äôt care whatever fate awaited him. The gangsters started cheering him for not judging them by their looks. But still nothing could gain this sad man‚Äôs interest.

Shigure Ui Loli God Song Origin Story - „É≠„É™Á•û„É¨„ÇØ„Ç§„Ç®„É†‚òÜ ‚ß∏ „Åó„Åê„Çå„ÅÜ„ÅÑÔºà9„Åï„ÅÑÔºâPart 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRSNqHre3dg,Studio Feureau,Film & Animation,[''],2023-10-28T15:05:06.595Z,"Shigure Ui is a Japanese illustrator and VTuber who is known for her cute and wholesome personality. However, in 2022, she released a song called ""Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem"" (Á≤õËÅñ!! „É≠„É™Á•û„É¨„ÇØ„Ç§„Ç®„É†), which is a dark and satirical song that denounces lolicons. The song quickly went viral, both in Japan and internationally, and has become one of Ui's most popular songs.

The origin story of ""Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem"" is somewhat convoluted, but it can be traced back to Ui's early days as a VTuber. In 2019, Ui started doing ""loli streams"" where she would read marshmallows (anonymous messages) from her audience in a loli voice. These streams were very popular with her fans, and Ui quickly became known as a ""loli VTuber.""

However, Ui was not entirely comfortable with being known as a loli VTuber. She has stated in the past that she does not like lolicons, and that she only did loli streams because they were popular with her audience.

In 2021, Ui decided to stop doing loli streams. She explained that she wanted to be known for more than just her loli voice, and that she wanted to create more diverse content.

However, Ui's decision to stop doing loli streams did not sit well with all of her fans. Some fans accused her of selling out, and others started to harass her online.

It was during this time that Ui started to write ""Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem."" The song is written from the perspective of Ui's fictional nine-year-old persona, ""Loli Ui."" In the song, Loli Ui threatens lolicons with imprisonment and taunts them in a roll call.

The music video for ""Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem"" is also very dark and satirical. It features danmaku 'barrage' comments inspired by the comment layout of video-sharing platform Nico Nico Douga, representing the sexual predators. However, the video also meta references Ui's own audience, and shows Loli Ui holding a fan meeting for them in prison.

""Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem"" was released on September 10, 2022, and it quickly went viral. The song has been praised by many for its unique and powerful message against loliconism. However, the song has also been criticized by some for its dark and satirical tone.

Despite the controversy, ""Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem"" has become one of Ui's most popular songs. The song has over 10 million views on YouTube, and it has been translated into multiple languages.

The Significance of ""Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem""

""Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem"" is a significant song for a number of reasons. First, it is a powerful message against loliconism. Loliconism is a form of sexual fetishization of children, and it is a serious problem in Japan. Ui's song is one of the few songs that directly addresses the issue of loliconism, and it does so in a way that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.

Second, ""Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem"" is a unique and innovative song. The song combines elements of pop, rock, and electronic music to create a sound that is both familiar and unfamiliar. The song's lyrics are also very clever and witty, and they satirize loliconism in a very effective way.

Finally, ""Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem"" is a testament to Ui's artistry and creativity. Ui is not only a talented singer and songwriter, but she is also a skilled illustrator and music video director. ""Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem"" is a complete work of art that showcases Ui's many talents.

The Impact of ""Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem""

""Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem"" has had a significant impact on the Japanese music industry and on the VTuber community.

First, the song has helped to raise awareness of the issue of loliconism in Japan. The song has been featured in major news outlets, and it has been the subject of much discussion on social media. As a result of the song's popularity, more people are now aware of the problem of loliconism, and more people are speaking out against it.

Second, ""Shukusei!! Loli Kami Requiem"" has helped to change the way that VTubers are perceived. In the past, VTubers were often seen as nothing more than idols who were only interested in making money from their fans. However, Ui's song has shown that VTubers can"

And with its stunning 8.8-inch QHD+ display with a 144Hz refresh rate, you'll enjoy immersive and fluid gameplay wherever you go.
But what really sets the Legion GO apart from other handheld gaming PCs is its versatility. It runs Windows 11 Home, so you can play games from any store, including Steam, the Epic Games Store, and the Microsoft Store. You can also use the Legion GO for productivity tasks, such as browsing the web, checking email, and creating documents.

The ASUS Zenbook Pro 16x just might be the best Windows laptop I've tried so far! Not only is it silly powerful, but it's also reasonable thin, light and silent when on battery (doing everyday tasks!) so it really feels like a laptop of two halves. It's all the power you need when you need it, but chill when you don't! 

Now we just need the battery life to keep getting better!

1Man, 1Band, 1Keyboard is the name of my concept (not a new one i think ^^).

It's entierly made by ""the mad keyboardist""

The challenge is to make a metal music with only keyboards.
I used shreddage for my guitar tone and EZ drummer for the drums.

Original song made with my band Orion.

Crossing Field (Instrumental),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTTFhDPBisg,Deaundre Phelps,People & Blogs,"['anime', 'sao', 'LIFE']",2023-10-26T21:24:20.060Z,This is my first time making a video at all but it was really fun(even though it must be easy for a lot of others but you know...whatever).
Kontakt vs Kontakt Player - What's the Difference?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq96oqPRk5U,Audio Plugin Deals,Music,"['audio plugin deals', 'kontakt player', 'kontakt retail', 'kontakt full', 'kontakt player vs kontakt retail', 'kontakt tutorial']",2023-10-26T21:22:39.380Z,"KONTAKT VS KONTAKT PLAYER 

In this video I‚Äôll be explaining the difference between sample libraries that are made for Kontakt and those made for Kontakt Player - so do subscribe for more videos like this and ring the bell to keep up to date with our notifications. 

The first thing to know: Native Instruments Kontakt sample player comes in two versions‚Ä¶ the free Kontakt Player, and Kontakt - sometimes referred to as Kontakt Full or Kontakt Retail.

Kontakt Player is free - just go to the Native Instruments website to download it.
Kontakt Full is not free - you need to buy this as a standalone product from Native Instruments.

Every sample library designed for Kontakt will run in Kontakt Full - but only some libraries will run in Kontakt Player.

So why the difference? Why doesn‚Äôt every developer make all of their sample libraries available for the free Kontakt player? 

It‚Äôs because developers who opt for this Kontakt player format must pay a licensing fee to Native Instruments and commit to purchasing a certain number of licenses. As a result, Kontakt Player libraries are often sold by larger, more established developers and they are a little higher priced than other libraries which use the full version of Kontakt.

What this means for you is that you need to be careful before you buy a sample library. Check the technical specifications and make sure that if you only have Kontakt player, then the library is compatible with the player. Look for graphics like THESE on the product page - they‚Äôll tell you if you need the full, paid version of Kontakt - or if you can just use the free player.

For more tips and tricks don't forget to subscribe and be sure to ring the bell to get notifications - thanks for watching.

What is your attention worth? FreeWater is begging us to rethink our current economic model by passing out completely free water bottles that leverage advertising on their packaging to cover the cost.

This concept challenges the conventional notion of monetizing resources and advocates for a paradigm shift toward accessible goods, looking to expand into other products, vending machines, and even become ‚Äúthe Whole Foods of free product.‚Äù

What if we could move away from scarcity-centered economics towards a more inclusive, socially beneficial framework, with water distribution serving as an initial stepping stone?

In 2022 I continued to see laptops develop. This year I anticipate a lot of developments in the software aspects of computer software. 2023 is looking to become the software race. We saw Intel push the hardware aspects in 2022, but I think the best laptops in 2023 will really need to benefit from increased utilization of the components that were already inside these laptops.

üí• SAVE an EXTRA 6% on your purchase ""BENKAISER6"" https://geni.us/Lenovo-US üí•
Experience the ultimate in laptop performance and design with the Lenovo Legion Slim 7i - a powerhouse built to exceed your creative needs. For three years running, the Lenovo Legion Slim 7i has remained my top pick for a 16-inch laptop, and it's not hard to see why.

At the heart of this sleek machine lies the i9-13900H processor and an RTX 4070 GPU, delivering unparalleled processing and graphics capabilities. But that's not all ‚Äì Lenovo's innovation truly shines with features like quiet mode and iGPU mode, optimizing performance and extending battery life. You'll be able to unleash your creativity for hours on end without worrying about running out of power.

08:22 - Final summary and conclusion

Let's talk about the display. The Lenovo Legion Slim 7i boasts a color-accurate and brilliantly bright screen, clocking in at nearly 500 nits of brightness. This means your visuals will pop with vibrant colors, making it a dream for content creators. And let's not forget the convenience of the SD card reader, dual USB type C ports, headphone jack, multiple USB type A ports, and an HDMI port ‚Äì a comprehensive set of connections for all your peripherals.

When it comes to build quality, Lenovo has nailed it. The laptop's aluminum chassis, side panels, and keyboard deck are a testament to the craftsmanship behind the device. Though the edge design might have a minor quirk, the overall construction is top-notch.

What sets the Slim 7i apart as the premier laptop in the Legion lineup is its slim profile combined with a full aluminum build. Even compared to the Pro 7i, which I've pitted against the Slim 7i in a head-to-head review, the latter's all-aluminum construction stands out.

Are you ready for some savings? You're in luck. As an exclusive offer for this channel, you can enjoy an additional 6% off your purchase by using the discount code ""BenGXtra6"" at lenovo.com. This limited-time offer is valid until the end of September, so don't miss out on the chance to upgrade your creative arsenal.

The Legion Slim 7i is equipped with a top-mounted webcam, providing crisp video quality for your virtual meetings and content creation. Plus, I've included quick samples of both audio and speaker quality, so you know exactly what to expect.

The keyboard on the Slim 7i is a delight to use, offering medium to long key travel, a full-size numeric keypad, and RGB lighting for that extra flair. While the trackpad could be larger ‚Äì a point of contention I've raised over the years ‚Äì it's a minor quibble in an otherwise exceptional laptop.

Let's talk battery life. With careful optimization ‚Äì setting screen brightness to 20%, enabling Windows battery saver mode, and utilizing hybrid GPU mode ‚Äì I've achieved around 10 hours of battery life for video playback and productivity tasks. This laptop strikes a great balance between performance and efficiency.

Looking under the hood, the Slim 7i's upgrade path is notable. With 16GB of RAM soldered onto the motherboard and an additional slot for expansion, you can easily boost your memory capacity. The same goes for storage ‚Äì with two M.2 slots, you have the flexibility to increase your storage space.

In conclusion, the Lenovo Legion Slim 7i is a complete package ‚Äì raw power, stunning design, and practical features tailored to creators. If you're ready to elevate your creative game, check the links in the description to make a purchase or explore more informative videos. Stay tuned for more insights and reviews ‚Äì see you in the next one!

Well, smoking any substance isn't going to be healthy for you, but there are studies conducted by the Royal College of Physicians that show that e-cigarettes available today are unlikely to exceed 5% of the harm from smoking tobacco.

Also, there is a new study as of January 2019 conducted by the New England Journal of Medicine. The study shows that for people trying to quit tobacco, switching to e-cigarettes was nearly TWICE as effective as using other forms of Nicotine Replacement Therapy.

We posted a video a while back discussing vaping risks and how e-cigarettes affect your mouth and gums. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btzUK1-TmrA

In this video we discussed some alarming studies that show that rates of #vaping in teens has almost doubled since 2018. We also covered a study that shows that the flavoring has been shown to kill epithelial cells which are cells that line the inside of the mouth. 

The rise of teens smoking e-cigarettes has been alarming, especially because many of these kids are not using their vapes to quit smoking tobacco, they are following a trend. 

We all know that smoking is not good for you. However, if you are trying to quit smoking cigarettes it can be a much healthier option for those people.

The Necessity of Violence,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmIOroDFhsg,ProfessorViral,Entertainment,"['anime', 'manga', 'professorviral', 'analysis', 'discussion', 'explained', 'video essay', 'psycho pass', 'psycho-pass', 'akane', 'makishima', 'kogami', 'sibyl', 'jormungand', 'jormangand', 'koko', 'jonah', 'vinland saga', 'canute', 'thorfinn', 'viking anime']",2023-10-25T11:05:03.733Z,"Violence, while its form will change greatly with time and place, may always be a necessity in the meeting of beings.

Psycho-Pass, the all-time great anime from Gen Urobuchi (Fate/Zero, Madoka Magica), is about society with Akane, free will with Kogami and Makishima, and the value of human beings with the Inspectors, Enforcers, and all alike, however included in this is also violence, with the Dominators enacting the Sibyl System‚Äôs will. Psycho-Pass presents a society under Sibyl which is seemingly ultra peaceful, but can a society ever be free of conflict, or is such a thing always a dangerous lie? Let‚Äôs analyze Urobuchi‚Äôs classic in this video essay and see what we can learn (again!)

Jormungand, often compared to Black Lagoon, is of course discussing violence with the anime‚Äôs aggressive use of weapons and war. Jormungand follows Koko Hekmatyar, an arms dealer, and her bodyguards, mostly Jonah, as they both inflame conflict‚Ä¶ and also prolong peace. Koko is a character showcasing human duality, as she sells weapons with the goal of peace, allowing someone who hates all weapons like Jonah to follow her. But with people like her brother Kasper who have no such moral objection to weapons and war, could this arms dealer truly provide world peace?

Vinland Saga, through Thors, Thorfiinn, Canute and more, discusses a much more brutal form of violence with its viking action. Whether they leave it like Thors, enter it like Thorfinn, or control it like Canute, this brutal nature touches every life in this viking world. Vinland Saga explains just how hard a path of peace can be in extreme detail, but analysis quickly reveals that the violent path, while simpler, can only ever lead to a worse future. And so, ‚Äúthe path of a true warrior‚Äù becomes one of peace; fighting against every single day.

A video essay analyzing and explaining the necessity of violence across three anime (Psycho-Pass, Jormungand [& Perfect Order], & Vinland Saga [Seasons 1 & 2])

'Color and Light' was a fantastic book, but its focus on traditional painting techniques and usage of paintings as examples, can sometimes make it challenging for me to grasp its application on digital illustration.)

Tasque Manager Model by Tofu

Big Band by RiRiLoLoArts1

Music used is mostly just stuff from the games talked about. The Big Band fight music was made by me, it's basically an improvised version of 'Landing of Yuri Gagarin (https://youtu.be/t5DEr8zrsn4)""
Ending song was also by me, which is an improvised version of 'The Good Life'.
(full version of my outro: https://youtu.be/6a_9HQW1VmY)

If you're curious, i've tried to make the FPS idea in UE4 before. I built the aforementioned 3 lane map, some rudimentary movement, and a weapon that launched bombs a-la the loose cannon. I lost the files to this last october during a computer re-build, and since this video is more performative than it is practical I didn't really want to try and remake it again. Maybe things will change and i'll try to make games myself one day, but that's not really how I balance my plate right now.  Thx 4 watch.

If you want to make any of these ideas, I'm 100% cool with it. If you want to bounce ideas or get feedback, my dms are open on Twitter and my email is thatfunkedude@gmail.com - pop me a concept credit and we're Gucci."

GUTS - Olivia Rodrigo
https://music.apple.com/us/album/guts/1694386825
https://open.spotify.com/album/1xJHno7SmdVtZAtXbdbDZp

Guts (stylized in all caps) is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo, released on September 8, 2023, via Geffen Records. It was written and recorded with Rodrigo working closely alongside Dan Nigro, the producer and multi-instrumentalist of her debut album Sour (2021). Inspired by the period of time immediately following Sour's success, Rodrigo conceived Guts hoping to reflect the process of maturity she experienced toward the end of her teenage years.

A sonically diverse pop record with energetic songs and soft ballads, Guts experiments with more rock influences than its predecessor, utilizing a variety of guitar and drum sounds from older alternative and pop rock styles. The subject matter deals with Rodrigo's transition from adolescence to adulthood and its tribulations.

Met with widespread acclaim from music critics, Guts was praised for Rodrigo's lyrical wit, complexity, and topicality as well as the overall music aesthetic and energy. Reviews noted both humorous and emotionally fraught lyrics in the album, detailing Rodrigo's struggles with identity, romantic and professional disillusionment, unexpected stardom, and societal expectations as a young woman.

Commercially, Guts topped the album charts in 14 countries, including the United States, Australia, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In its US debut, it recorded 302,000 first-week album-equivalent units while charting all 12 of its songs in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. Three singles were released from the album, including the international number-one track ""Vampire"" and the top-10 charting ""Bad Idea Right?"" and ""Get Him Back!"" To further support the album, Rodrigo will embark on the Guts World Tour in 2024."

If anyone thinking of buying  an Asus Rog Zephyrus M16 GU 603 (2021) model in 2022 and unsure about the fan noise in the laptop, In this video I gave you a demonstration of all the fan mode and the noise level of the laptop. In my opinion, the fan noise is not that bad. The only time the laptop fan makes too much noise is when it is in turbo mode. But other than that, on daily basis the fan noise should not bother anyone.

Thanks

Whether you're using it as a tablet, in tent mode, or just a standard gaming laptop, it's got something for everyone in a truly unique and one-of-a-kind package. Touchscreen, QHD 1600p, glossy Mini-LED ""Nebula HDR"" display with 1,100 nits of brightness, Nvidia RTX 4060 or 4070 graphics, and this year they switched from AMD Ryzen 6900HS to Intel i9-13900H. It's got plenty of juice to run your favorite games at max settings, but is the 2023 model really worth it over last year's? We're here to find out!

We'll also compare it to other laptops like the Razer Blade 15, Lenovo Legion 7i Pro, and Zephyrus M16.

TDP isn't everything. Here we are again, this time the shorter version of my 45 minute review video on these two super-popular RTX 3070 laptops. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND with this video (which dives into my personal preferences) I'm talking about the Legion 5 Pro IN COMPARISON TO THE G15, not just on it's own. I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE I HATE THE LEGION 5 PRO. Trust me, it's a great laptop though, I don't hate it. On its own, it's awesome. I wouldn't regret purchasing it if I didn't have the G15 first. But I have preferences, I have opinions. I've extensively tested and used both of these machines and these are just my personal thoughts on them. Obviously my performance benchmarks, speaker tests, fan noise tests, and thermal tests are backed by data though so you can decide which is better there.

my new album ""nurture"" is out now: https://porterrobinson.co/nurture

sometimes when making music or art, we can think of ourselves as working alone. But that isn't ever really the case -- if I think about it, if I was raised in total isolation without exposure to culture, I would never have come up with any of the concepts of harmony, rhythm, twelve notes in a scale, the idea of chords, the idea of melody, the concept of a 'chorus' or 'verse' or 'drum' -- much less would I be able to physically build an instrument, build a computer, or write music production software. Everything we create is, in essence, a collaboration with millions of strangers. And by creating and sharing our ideas, we're afforded the gift of being able to contribute to this legacy. I think of the story of human creativity as this beautiful tapestry that each of us is given the very very brief opportunity to sew our own patch onto. 

the ""Look at the Sky"" video is about the beauty I find in this cycle. where the meaning of the song is more directly about the value of hope and resilience in the face of despair, with the video, i wanted to extend the idea of 'being alive next year' from being literal into being a metaphor about the things we can contribute to this world that will outlast us.

Lyrics:

Verse:
Is it fate?
if it‚Äôs not easy, it must not be
At that age
I cherished the flowers beneath my feet
But then something must have changed in me,
I used to feel so light
Now I‚Äôll try,
I just want time
 
Pre-Chorus:
Wait again,
I will be much better then
Holding on, I said:
‚ÄúI will be much better, then‚Äù

Chorus:
Look at the sky, I‚Äôm still here
I‚Äôll be alive next year
I can make something good, oh
Something good
Look at the sky, I‚Äôm still here
I‚Äôll be alive next year
I can make something good, oh
Something good
 
Verse:
Are you close?
Shouldn‚Äôt it come to you naturally?
And everyone knows:
You‚Äôre losing your gift, and it‚Äôs plain to see
But then something must have changed in me,
I don‚Äôt fear it anymore
Now I‚Äôm sure
I‚Äôm sure

Bridge:
Look at the sky, I‚Äôm still here
I‚Äôll be alive next year
I can make something good, oh
Something good
Look at the sky, I‚Äôm still here
I‚Äôll be alive next year
I can make something good, oh
Something good

Pre-Chorus:
Wait again, I will be much better then
And suddenly, I‚Äôve restored your faith in me

Chorus:
Look at the sky
Look at the sky, I‚Äôm still here
I‚Äôll be alive next year
I can make something good, oh
Something good
Look at the sky, I‚Äôm still here
I‚Äôll be alive next year
I can make something good, oh
Something good

Outro:
Look at the sky, I‚Äôm still here
I‚Äôll be alive next year
I can make something good
Something good
Look at the sky, I‚Äôm still here
I‚Äôll be alive next year
I can make something good
Something good

Lyrics:
if i send this void away,
have i lost a part of me?
when you wake you‚Äôre bargaining 
for the promise to come back

cause getting made you want more
and hoping made you hurt more
oh there must be 
something wrong with me 
and getting made you want more
and hoping made you hurt more
someone tell me 
something comforting 

take what you want, but you‚Äôre tied by the tooth
wasn‚Äôt it meant to relieve you?
so suffer the signs that you needed to change
heed all the ways you‚Äôd been thinking

cause getting made you want more
and hoping made you hurt more
oh there must be 
something wrong with me 
cause getting made you want more
and hoping made you hurt more
someone tell me 
something comforting

something comforting
something comforting
something comforting
something comforting

something comforting
something comforting
something comforting
something comforting

something comforting

and hoping made you hurt more
oh there must be 
something wrong with me
cause getting made you want more
and hoping made you hurt more
someone tell me 
something comforting

oh, something comforting"

Lyrics :

i could never find the right way to tell you
have you noticed i've been gone?
cause i left behind the home that you made me
but i will carry it along

mm it's a long way forward
so trust in me
i'll give them shelter like you've done for me
and i know i'm not alone
you'll be watching over us
until you're gone

when i'm older i'll be silent beside you
I know that words are not enough
and they won't need to know our names or our faces
but they will carry on for us

Lyrics:

No, I don't miss the feeling anymore
Yeah, I want something new to love
I was so nostalgic,
but I'm fine without it
You don't really want what you think you want
No, I don't wanna lose it
this emotion
Yeah, I just wanna do everything
I get so excited
when I finally find it
It just gets brighter from now on

Then you sigh:
""You know I love you, so I think I should tell you, Porter,
this life: isn't it time that you grow up?""

(Chorus)
Oh, it's calling
I just can't stop, I'm sorry
I can feel a new day dawning
(I burn up, burn out -
I shouldn't do this to myself)

But sincerely,
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clearly
(I burn up, burn out -
I shouldn't do this to myself)

Well, this is why we do it,
for the feeling.
How do you do music?
Well, it's easy:
You just face your fears and
you become your heroes
I don't understand why you're freaking out

Then they say:
""Fine, well do what you need to
But I don‚Äôt want to see you
Wasting your life
Isn‚Äôt it time you get a job?""

(Chorus)
Oh, it's calling
I just can't stop, I'm sorry
I can feel a new day dawning
(I burn up, burn out -
I shouldn't do this to myself)

But sincerely,
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clearly
(I burn up, burn out -
I shouldn't do this to myself)

But sincerely,
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clearly,
and I know it doesn't last,
but I don't mind at all anymore

(Chorus)
Oh, it's calling
I just can't stop, I'm sorry
I can feel a new day dawning
(I burn up, burn out - 
I shouldn't do this to myself)

But sincerely,
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clearly
(I burn up, burn out -
I shouldn't do this to myself)

The Best Way to Automate Volume in Ableton Live,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5ry2yBihPE,Music Production w/ Brian Funk,Music,"['ableton', 'music', 'electronic', 'how to', 'tutorial', 'afrodjmac', 'music production', 'brian funk', 'ableton live', 'creativity', 'productivity', 'philosophy', 'studio', 'recording', 'recording studio', 'home studio', 'live performance', 'ableton certified trainer', 'synthesizers', 'synths', 'drums', 'guitar', 'producer', 'musician', 'song writing', 'ableton push', 'free download', 'ableton live pack', 'volume automation', 'mixing']",2023-10-23T01:16:06.093Z,"Free Download of the  Easy Volume Rider Ableton Live Pack: https://brianfunk.com/blog/volume-rider

There's a problem when you automate the volume fader in Ableton Live. If you want to change the overall level of the track, moving the volume fader overrides the automation. 

I've got a better way to automate volume that allows you to create as much automation as you want and retain the ability to use the volume fader for overall level changes.

The Verge's $2000 PC Build Reaction Supercut,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-2Scfj4FZk,Omnizoa,Science & Technology,"['PC', 'build', 'guide', 'tutorial', 'fakenews', 'the verge', 'vox', 'vox media', 'journalism', 'gaming', 'tech', 'advice', 'response', 'reaction', 'criticism', 'compilation', 'supercut']",2023-10-22T15:29:30.257Z,"Check out my Reaction Supercut of Linus Tech Tips' Linux Daily Driver Challenge:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up2Za7luucU

I don't know much about making computers, but I sure learned a lot when The Verge tried to make one.  Tells you a lot about the credibility of these ""tech reporters"", which, in case you didn't already know, are run by Vox (which should be warning enough already).  Their ""how-to guide"" video was posted September 13th, 2018, and less than a week later, Vox would take down this video, accuse it's critics of toxicity, harassment, and racism, before ultimately issuing illicit copyright takedown notices to Youtubers who posted responses addressing it's various errors, poor instruction, and misinformation.  The Verge cited ""editorial standards"" as the reason for retracting the video, but that evidently hasn't stopped them before and it wasn't until an informed audience revealed their entire company to be a sham that they did anything about it.

Please Remember: The Verge is a company of Vox journalists, they are not to be considered in touch with any dimension of reality.

Their accompanying, albeit amended, article is still viewable.  Needless to say, it should not be considered trustworthy PC building advice: https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/13/17828092/gaming-pc-build-custom-how-to-asus-intel-geforce-cost

Danny Brown - ‚ÄòAin't It Funny‚Äô Lyrics:

Verbal couture
Parkour
With the metaphors
The flow house of horror
Dead bolted with metal doors
Grinch bitch
Six sense
With a nose drip
Mind skydive
Sniffing bumps
In the cockpit
Locksmith of Hip Hop
Appraisal the wrist watch
The rocks bout the size
As the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth
Sock out the mic
Prototype for Adderall
Your work killing fiends
Cause you cut it with Fentanyl
So much coke
Just to sniff need a ski lift
Flip your table over
If you cut it with the bullshit
Nose bleeds red carpets
But it just blend in
Snapping pictures
Feeling my chest being sunk in
Live a fast life
Seen many die slowly
Unhappy when they left
So I try to seize the moment

Funny how it happens
Who ever would imagine
That jokes on you
But Satan the one laughing

Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it

I can sell honey to a bee
In the fall time
Make trees
Take back they leaves
Octopus in a straight jacket
Savage with bad habits
Broke serving fiends
Got rich became a addict
Ain‚Äôt it funny how it happens
Who would ever would imagine
Nose running right now
Could ya pass me a napkin
Managed to somehow
To have the upper advantage
Panic when the drugs are gone
And nobody is answering
Ain‚Äôt it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
No way to mask it
A lot became has beens
Rolling up that 100 dollar bill
Till they cash in
Thinks it gone last
Going too fast
Man it's fucked up
Ain't it funny how it happens

Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happen

Upcoming heavy traffic
Say ya need to slow down
Cause you feel yourself crashing
Staring in the devil face
But ya can‚Äôt stop laughing
Staring in the devil face
But ya can't stop laughing
It‚Äôs a living nightmare
That most of us might share
Inherited in our blood
It's why we stuck in the mud
Can‚Äôt quit the drug use
Or the alcohol abuse
Even if I wanted to
Tell you what I‚Äôm gonna do
I‚Äôma wash away my problems
With this bottle of Henny
Anxiety got the best of me
So popping them Xannies
Might need rehab
But to me that shit pussy
Pray for me y‚Äôall
Cause I don't know what coming to me
Bought a 8 ball of coke
And my nigga on the way
Got 3 hoes with him
And they all tryna play

Ain't it funny how it happens
Who ever would imagine
Jokes on you
But Satan the one laughing

Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it
Ain't it funny how it happens
Ain't it

About me: https://mikeobrienmedia.com

This is the new Asus Zenbook Pro and I wanted to find out why this was selling out everywhere. Now after using it for the past week, it is clear to me. This could very well end up being the perfect laptop for certain types of users and there are main reasons. Let me explain. So this laptop comes in a few configurations, but they are all pretty stacked with a powerful processor and graphics card while offering a very accurate display which really intrigued me. I was fortunate enough to get my hands on this 14inch OLED laptop (UX6404) when the folks at ASUS agreed to send me one and partner up for this video. Of course, all opinions are my own, but we want to keep this completely unbiased, so I am going to show you actual testing. I have a lot of tests to show you, and some really might surprise you.

Please comment below with any questions you might have.  Thank you all for watching! I appreciate you!

Things I noticed

Almost no bloatware. I rejected McAfee when I set it up and I muted one or two notifications but it is not nearly what many other laptops are. 

Comes with a case

Battery life: about 8-9 hrs with video playback

Drawback: All type C ports are on one side

Drawback: fingerprints

The price is $1799 right now and I have a link below

Conclusion: 
 This is geared towards content creators with the great dislay, CPU, and GPU combo in a compact device that is easy to travel with or expand to a large desk setup with multiple displays"

In a world plagued by threatening creatures known as Kaiju, Kafka Hibino aspired to enlist in the Japan Defense Force to defeat them.

""Let's wipe out the Kaiju together.""

Kafka pledged to his childhood friend, Mina Ashiro. Over time, life circumstances forced them to go their separate ways and caused him to abandon his lifelong ambition.

He found himself employed by Monster Sweeper, Inc., a professional cleaning company that specializes in cleaning up the aftermath of Kaiju battles. Meanwhile, Mina Ashiro is now the Captain of the Defense Force's 3rd Division. As it stands, he is currently unworthy of fighting Kaiju alongside her.

At work, Kafka crosses paths with the highly motivated Reno Ichikawa. Reno's undying determination to join the Defense Force leaves no room for failure. His perseverance reawakens Kafka's ambition of standing next to Mina as they protect humanity from Kaiju together.

A dream frozen by time, thawed by a burning promise.

Enough of the funny art kid shit, we get it. Have you heard of real hip hop? We do that here. We value bars on The Cave. This week, we‚Äôre joined by Detroit artist Boldy James and producer legend Alchemist. Unfortunately, Alchemist forgot his flux capacitor at home and his particle accelerator is still undergoing repairs in Geneva. We were hoping he could at least bring in his quantum computer from Zurich...but apparently if it is extracted from the dilution refrigerator and exposed to temperatures above 1 degree Kelvin, you can forget about initializing any kind of meaningful qubit sequence. This is all to say that he could not participate in the beat-making process per se, but he was able to identify the presence of Ron Artest‚Äôs spirit in the acoustic panels of the studio walls. Meanwhile Boldy, feeling philanthropic, offers up what we thought would be a four-bar giveaway to one lucky raffle winner. I even entered the sweepstakes myself in sweaty desperation, given the current bar drought wreaking havoc on the environment. Thankfully, when he does enter the booth, we get much more than we were promised, a surplus of bars in fact. And just like in Mad Max: Fury Road, when Immortan Joe releases the water onto the peasants of the desert wasteland below, the bars rain down on us. The Price Of Tea In China is available to stream everywhere.

Our guest brings out his legendary bass guitar and plays along to one of the most frenetic, psychotic instrumentals ever made, using his patent-pending gang sign finger techniques. It‚Äôs a wild ride, and Kenny does his best to keep things grounded. But by the time we get into the booth, all bets are off. We witness art in its truest form, a man unmoored from the tethers of any earthly nature, struck like lightning with the gift of an ancient, extraterrestrial broadcast. If you listen closely to his freestyle, you can hear the ocean, the meaning of life, and the nuclear codes.

KENNY BEATS & DANNY BROWN FREESTYLE | The Cave: Season 2 - Episode 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7oPxZxQ1W4,Kenny Beats,Music,"['kenny beats', 'dont over over think shit', 'dont', 'over', 'think', 'shit', 'kenny', 'beats', 'danny', 'brown', 'danny brown']",2023-10-21T20:58:11.474Z,"Welcome back to The Cave. The show where rappers make raps and Kenny Beats makes beats. At the end of each episode, we get a completely original track made from scratch. Last season generated some unforgettable performances, revealed some rare studio moments, and even birthed a handful of memes. This time around we hope to deliver some of the same elements that people have come to know and love about this show in its still nascent form, but we also hope to somehow, incomprehensibly, come even harder. Every other week, religiously, we‚Äôll be releasing a brand new episode with a brand new guest.

Kicking off this season is Detroit legend Danny Brown. We learn about how Kenny and Danny‚Äôs paths crossed for the first time almost a decade ago. We learn about how the real life Pootie Tang saved Danny‚Äôs life with a belt. We learn the WiFi network. And by the end, we all learn something about ourselves.

The Cave is a bi-weekly freestyle series hosted by Kenny Beats featuring a new artist each episode. One 10 minute beat from Kenny, 16-32 bars from a friend, every other week.

The big difference is that it feels way sleeker and more well-built than anything that‚Äôs come before. HP touts the Spectre Fold as the company‚Äôs first 3-in-1 as it can seamlessly switch between tablet, multiple laptop configurations and even a portable all-in-one depending on how you bend its 17-inch OLED display. It‚Äôs clever design also includes hidden magnetic charging coils that allow the system to top off its included Bluetooth keyboard and stylus when not in use, so you never have to worry about doing that yourself. And the Spectre Fold is thinner and lighter than all of its rivals too, weighing under three pounds and measuring just 8.5mm thick (unfolded). The huge downside is that it costs $5,000, so if you want one you better start saving up.

The Ultimate Bang-for-Buck Racing Sim! My Gran Turismo 7 Setup,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJLr2pDeQso,Jorge Powell,People & Blogs,[''],2023-10-21T20:24:34.248Z,"If there's one thing you should know about sim racing, it's that it's not a cheap hobby. After factoring in the cost of a wheel, pedals, and a cockpit, it can end up costing thousands of pounds just to get started - and that doesn't even include all the hardware required to actually run the game itself.

In this video, I‚Äôll walk you through my sim racing setup, which I‚Äôve carefully designed to enhance every aspect of my virtual driving experience, while staying within a sensible budget. If you wanted to check these products out for yourself, I‚Äôve left links to everything in the description below.

Whether you're using it as a tablet, in tent mode, or just a standard gaming laptop, it's got something for everyone in a truly unique and one-of-a-kind package. Touchscreen, QHD 1600p, glossy Mini-LED ""Nebula HDR"" display with 1,100 nits of brightness, Nvidia RTX 4060 or 4070 graphics, and this year they switched from AMD Ryzen 6900HS to Intel i9-13900H. It's got plenty of juice to run your favorite games at max settings, but is the 2023 model really worth it over last year's? We're here to find out!

We'll also compare it to other laptops like the Razer Blade 15, Lenovo Legion 7i Pro, and Zephyrus M16.

In this video, we're diving into two of my favorite ASUS laptops: the ASUS Republic of Gamers Zephyrus G14 and the ASUS Republic of Gamers Flow X13. Right off the bat, I'll spoil it for you - the X13 has taken the crown as my new favorite thin and light laptop from ASUS. But don't write off the G14 just yet; I'll help you decide which G14 model to consider.

Let's kick things off by talking about the major improvement in the X13 ‚Äì the large glass trackpad. ASUS has made a fantastic move by bringing this to the X13, making it neck and neck with the G14. The X13 is a thin and light laptop with excellent battery life and a more compact form factor compared to the G14. While the G14 offers a variety of SKUs with different GPUs, the X13 gives you the choice of Radeon graphics with the Ryzen 9 7940HS, RTX 4050, or RTX 4070.

Now, let's address the elephant in the room ‚Äì the price. Both the G14 and X13 have seen significant price increases in 2023. If you're looking for the best bang for your buck, I recommend considering the 2022 version of the G14 with the RX 6700S or RX 6800S, which can still be found online and often at a better price with solid performance.

Let's talk about connectivity. The G14 offers slightly better connectivity with features like the ROG XG Mobile connector port. If you plan to get the XG Mobile, consider the integrated graphics version of the X13 to save money since the dedicated GPU only performs at its best when connected to power.

Now, a quick overview of the ports ‚Äì the X13 has USB-C, a micro SD card reader, HDMI, and a headphone jack. The G14 boasts two USB type A ports, one USB-C, and a micro SD card reader on one side, and on the other side, you'll find two more USB type A ports, one USB-C, HDMI, and a headphone jack. Keep in mind that the X13 charges via USB-C, while the G14 has a dedicated power adapter.

Next, let's examine the build quality. Both laptops are well-assembled, but the X13 offers a thinner and lighter profile with a more professional, less gamer-like aesthetic. The G14 features ASUS' ErgoLift design, which slightly elevates the chassis for improved ventilation. In contrast, the X13 is a two-in-one laptop and can be used with an ASUS Pen 2.0 for tasks that require precise input.

Battery life is crucial for many users. The X13 and G14 have similar battery capacities, with the G14 edging out slightly in our tests. However, the difference is minor, so either laptop will provide solid battery life.

In terms of performance, the X13 and G14 come with different GPU options. The exact model you choose will determine your performance level. In synthetic benchmarks, the X13, especially the RTX 4070 variant, often performs impressively well, rivaling or even surpassing the G14's performance. However, real-world applications like Photoshop, After Effects, and Blender reveal more nuanced differences.

If you work with DaVinci Resolve or 4K video exports, the G14 with the RTX 4090 is a solid choice, offering faster export times than the X13. However, the X13 holds its own and provides reasonable performance, especially considering its form factor.

Finally, let's talk about upgrade options. The G14 offers better upgradeability, with the ability to upgrade RAM and M.2 drives. In contrast, the X13 allows for limited upgrades, with no option to expand RAM and only one M.2 slot.

Ultimately, your choice between these two laptops depends on your priorities and budget. Keep in mind that both laptops have seen price increases in 2023, so consider your specific needs and use cases when making your decision. Thanks for watching, and be sure to check out more videos on the G14 and X13 on my channel. See you in the next one!

In this comprehensive review, we dive deep into the Asus Republic of Gamers Zephyrus G14, a laptop that's caught our attention throughout 2021, 2022, and now 2023. We'll cover the pros and cons, helping you decide if it's the right choice for you.

Spec Options Galore
One standout feature this year is the array of spec options available. There's something for everyone from the RTX 4050 to the mighty 4090, along with various Ryzen configurations. These choices ensure you can tailor the laptop to your specific needs.

Pricing Structure Concerns
While the G14 continues to impress, there's a pricing shift that's worth considering. Removing Radeon variants means that matching the previous year's performance may require a higher-end model, significantly impacting your budget.

RAM and Display Enhancements
On the bright side, Asus has upped the ante with RAM. You can now expand up to 80GB, a substantial improvement over previous iterations. There's also the option of a mini LED display, offering improved color range and brightness, though with slightly reduced color accuracy.

Battery Life Excellence
One area where the G14 continues to shine is battery life. In Eco mode, it can deliver an impressive 12 hours of productivity or 11 hours of streaming, making it a reliable companion for on-the-go productivity.

Real-World Performance
Let's talk about real-world performance. In various software applications like Photoshop, After Effects, Blender, and more, we break down the differences between the RTX 4060 and 4090 models. RAM upgrades play a crucial role, so keep that in mind when making your decision.

Price vs. Performance
The price increase for higher-end models might give you pause. Is it worth the investment to match or surpass the performance of the previous year's Radeon models? We explore these questions in-depth to help you make an informed choice.

Editing Capabilities
For video editing enthusiasts, we break down the editing capabilities of both models, focusing on 4K and 6K exports in Premiere Pro. The results might surprise you, especially when comparing with last year's model.

Final Thoughts
In summary, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 remains a formidable laptop in 2023. However, the pricing shift and the absence of Radeon options raise some concerns. It's crucial to evaluate your specific needs and budget before making a decision.

Well turns out there's still devices out there with things like optical drives, full sized SD card readers, and VGA, while also having modern comforts like Thunderbolt 4.

How I learnt Norwegian on my own,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWQYqcFX8JE,Norwegian with Ilys,Education,[''],2023-10-21T02:46:45.527Z,"Hi, my name is Ilys, I was born and raised in France, and today I have lived in Norway for 3 years. Since the beginning, moving to Norway hasn't felt like moving away from home, but going home. Today it really much feels like I have two homes, and like family or friends, I love both France and Norway equally, but for total different reasons. 

I learnt Norwegian on my own and am today totally fluent, and on this channel I want to help you learn for Norwegian to become whatever you want it to become for you. 

I have gotten so many questions about how I learnt Norwegian, and today I finally made a video where I try to answer to many questions I have gotten, and where I explain how I learnt, as well as to give you recommendations for which sources to use. 

I really hope that this video will help you in your journey,

This part is here to show people who correct my use of ""Lo quiero"".
Lo quiero is what I say at the end of every video. I know it's ""wrong"", but something can only be wrong if it is not what you intended to say, and it IS what I intend to say.
It's a reference to a film that I watched in Spanish 50 times, thus essentially memorising the Spanish script for. Thanks for watching to the end, y lo quiero."

___________________________________________

Have you ever found yourself creating THOUSANDS of flashcards to cram for your next exam? If so, you probably know that relying solely on flashcards is not a feasible approach to ensure you're adequately prepared - if you‚Äôre using flashcards to try and UNDERSTAND information, then I‚Äôm sorry to say, there will also be limitations.¬†

You‚Äôre learning information in isolation and you‚Äôre not looking at how information comes together to form a bigger picture. Nowadays exams arent just testing understanding. Instead, they‚Äôre testing your ability to apply, analyse and evaluate, also known as the higher orders of thinking skills required for higher-order learning.

Because of the lower-order nature of flashcards as a technique, your brain doesn‚Äôt hold onto information very well so your brain doesn‚Äôt see it as very relevant to hold on to, and when information isn‚Äôt made RELEVANT, your brain will not bother dedicating the extra energy to remember that information in the future. This means you will end up forgetting that information more easily!

By adopting our approach, which involves Relational prioritised learning, only using flashcards for isolated facts and Interleaving, you can efficiently grasp the content on your initial encounter with it. 

Are you ready? Let‚Äôs get into it!

THE BEYOND: A Massive Leap For VR Headsets,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCXmv27o3AU,ThrillSeeker,Science & Technology,"['vr', 'virtual reality', 'quest 3', 'beyond', 'bigscreen beyond', 'valve index', 'thrillseeker', 'tuesday newsday', 'quest 2', 'quest', 'meta quest', 'oculus quest', 'VR games', 'VR headset', 'Best VR headset', 'Best VR games', 'ar', 'augmented reality']",2023-10-19T11:17:52.273Z,"Hello! 
This is probably the longest review period for any VR headset I have ever tried; for the past 6 months I've been using the beyond just about every single day. I've found a lot of positives- I really like the beyond, but it's not perfect and its certainly not for everyone. 

But It just might be the best PCVR headset available if you can stomach the price. I will be re-reviewing the Varjo Aero soon and Reviewing the Pimax Crystal as well. 

I hope you enjoy this video.
