NewJeans burst onto the K-pop scene in summer 2022 with their debut single, “Attention.” Less than one year later, NewJeans broke the Guinness World Record for fastest K-pop group to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify. 

We sat down with MINJI, HANNI, DANIELLE, HAERIN, and HYEIN to cover everything from DANIELLE’s favorite surfing spot to the song HANNI loves to play on ukulele and which Harry Potter house each member would reside. Ten points if you can guess who’s in Slytherin!

Apple Lossless compression: The Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC), also known as Apple Lossless, or Apple Lossless Encoder (ALE), is an audio coding format, and its reference audio codec implementation, developed by Apple Inc. for lossless data compression of digital music. After initially keeping it proprietary from its inception in 2004, in late 2011 Apple made the codec available open source and royalty-free. Traditionally, Apple has referred to the codec as Apple Lossless, though more recently it has begun to use the abbreviated term ALAC when referring to the codec

"Kanye Creates a New Beat in Real Time in ""jeen-yuhs"" Unreleased Scene",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhOsxMhe8eo,TIME,News & Politics,[''],2023-10-18T22:32:14.861Z,"While Kanye West, who has changed his legal name to Ye, is best recognized today as an ultra-famous rapper and a polarizing public figure, his origins as a producer for the likes of Jay-Z, Mos Def, and Lil’ Kim can’t be overlooked. In fact, it’s West’s tireless quest to be taken seriously as a rapper and not just a producer that provides rich fodder for Jeen-Yuhs, Netflix’s three-part documentary about the artist. (Jeen-Yuhs is produced by TIME Studios, the film and television division of TIME.)

For as hard as he worked to break free of being boxed in as a producer, there’s no denying that West’s production skills were—and still are—exceptional. And while West manifested the career as a rapper that he always dreamed of (with 22 Grammy wins to date), over the course of his nearly three decades in the music industry, his production has still had an outsized influence on the sound of the zeitgeist, both through his own albums and others’.

In an exclusive clip that didn’t make the final cut of Jeen-Yuhs, West the producer is seen in full force. During the time that this scene was filmed in the summer of 2017, he was hard at work producing five albums under his GOOD Music label, including Teyana Taylor’s K.T.S.E., an album that’s now widely regarded as one of R&B’s new classics.

In the clip, West is seen working in the studio with Taylor on the song “Cold Blooded,” which was ultimately left out of the album. He strips the song completely of its old beat, then creates a new one from scratch in a matter of minutes. It’s an illuminating look at his artistic process.

He regales us with lurid tales of coke-snorting dinner companions and misplaced pussy hairs while Kenny Beats prepares an appropriate instrumental for the occasion. No sooner than Kenny (who against all odds has continued to be a white man from Connecticut) finishes the beat, Gibbs is in the booth tearing down our beloved studio with an effortless freestyle, riffing on a classic Juicy J verse. He then drops the mic in dramatic fashion, not unlike our 44th president at his final White House Correspondents’ Dinner. We as an audience are left feeling blessed, moved, and like we truly learned something today.

The Cave is a bi-weekly freestyle series hosted by Kenny Beats featuring a new artist each episode. One 10 minute beat from Kenny, 16-32 bars from a friend, every other week.

I've sent this video to Jacksfilm's team for the JJJacksfilms Google Doc and I hope that this can end up in the video.

Some people wanted to hear DOOM over a Conductor Williams beat when he was alive and I had envisioned the ""Euro Step"" beat with DOOM's verses on ""Melody"" by Blendcrafters.

The Cardinal were led by wide receiver Elic Ayomanor, who put up a monster stat line of 13 catches for 294 yards and three touchdowns. The loss is absolutely crushing for Coach Prime and Colorado, as it puts their bowl hopes in serious jeopardy and kill the momentum they have built up to this point in the season.

About The New Negroes with Baron Vaughn & Open Mike Eagle:
The New Negroes with Baron Vaughn & Open Mike Eagle is a socially aware stand-up and music series. Vaughn and Eagle took inspiration for the series and title from the term “New Negro,” as popularized during the Harlem Renaissance, and it refers to black Americans speaking up, telling their own stories and affirming their various identities to dismantle outdated assumptions and beliefs.

How to PROPERLY Bench Press for Growth (5 Easy Steps),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y2ZdHCOXok,Jeremy Ethier,People & Blogs,"['bench press', 'bench press form', 'bench press technique', 'barbell bench press', 'how to bench press for chest growth', 'how to bench press properly', 'how to bench press', 'bench press workout', 'chest bench press', 'how to do bench press for chest', 'chest press', 'how to do bench press', 'proper bench press workout', 'builtwithscience', 'jeremyethier', 'how to bench', 'proper bench form', 'barbell bench', 'bench press tips', 'bench press fail', 'how to bench press more weight', 'how to bench press for beginners']",2023-10-18T12:08:23.156Z,"With proper bench press form, the bench is the GOAT of upper body exercises. Learn how to bench press properly and you’ll see massive gains in your chest, shoulders, and arms. But get your bench press technique wrong, and even if it doesn’t happen right away, you risk seriously injuring your shoulders and elbows to the point where you may never be able to barbell bench press again. But don’t worry, perfect bench form is actually quite simple. Learn how to bench press for chest growth in 5 steps. 

The most important part to getting your bench press form right is with step 1, setup. To find the perfect grip width for you, lay down on the bench with your arms straight in front of you. Pull your elbows back until they make a 90 degree angle. Then, bring your elbows in towards your sides until your thumbs line up with your nipples. The distance between your hands is your ideal grip distance on the bar. Then, for a smooth unracking, position your body such that your eyes are directly under the barbell. And when you grab the bar, for the most secure grip, I’d recommend keeping your thumb around the bar. Finally, walk your feet back under your knees and plant them firmly into the ground. 

Step 2: create whole body tension. Before you even consider unracking the bar, you need to activate various muscles that will help unlock your bench press strength and keep you stable as you lift. Use your quads to push your feet down into the ground and use your glutes to drive your knees out. Then, activate your lats by bringing your armpits down to your hips. You can imagine there was a band attached to the bar pulling it back as you try to pull it forward. Next, we want to create an arch in your upper back by thinking about opening up and extending your chest. Once you’ve set your arch, straighten your wrists by pointing your knuckles to the ceiling. Then, through your nose take a deep 360 breath into your abdomen, and brace your core. 

Now, step 3: unracking. This is where most people lose all their tension and mess up their bench press technique before they’ve even started it. To avoid this, maintain your arch and stay tight, then push the bar up to get it off the rack. From there you want to use your lats to “pull” the bar into the starting position right above your shoulders. Then, re-engage your lats by thinking about bending the bar in half. 

Step 4: descent. The most common mistake people make here with the barbell bench press has to do with the bar path. During a proper bench press the bar should not travel straight up and down. Instead, you’ll want to bring it down and slightly forwards. To do so, focus on pulling the bar down towards your lower chest, right around the level of your nipples. As you do this, avoid tucking your elbows too close into the body and also avoid the more common mistake of flaring them out to the sides. Instead, to maximize chest activation and minimize shoulder discomfort, keep them tucked at about a 45 to 70 degree angle away from your body. Now as for how deep to go, ideally, you want to touch your chest with the bar. But if your shoulders roll forward at the bottom (which can cause discomfort and potential injury), stop an inch or two above your chest or wherever is most comfortable. But once you do reach the bottom position, your forearms should not be bent inward or outward. If they are, try narrowing or widening your grip to get your elbows stacked directly under your wrists. 

Step 5: ascent. Most people lose out on chest gains by letting the bar bounce off their chest. Instead, force your chest to work even harder by pausing here for half a second. But do NOT completely relax and let the bar simply sit on top of you. Keep the tension in your legs and upper back and feel your chest working to keep the bar stable. After the slight pause, use your quads to push your feet forward against the ground as if you were doing a leg extension, and then drive the bar up off your chest. Drive the bar back up towards your head so that from the side view, the bar travels in a slight arc. As you get to the top, keep your chest up by maintaining the arch in your upper back and squeeze your biceps into your armpits until your arms fully straighten over your shoulders. Exhale through pursed lips as you come to the top, take another deep breath in your stomach, brace, and then control the weight back down for another rep. 

And ... congrats! You now know how to bench press for chest growth.

A great career or business requires hard work.

A healthy body needs exercise and foods you don't necessarily like.

Meaningful relationships need vulnerability and compromises.

In fact, anything worthwhile often requires that you do what you don't want to do.

And that can be hard.

But it doesn't have to be.

The Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod has been available for quite a while but it's been one of the most difficult VR mods to run due to Cyberpunk 2077s high demand on PC specs when it comes to achieving solid performance. I previously settled for medium to low graphics presets and a resolution of around 1640x1640 and STILL only got around 30-40fps in VR... but now thanks to the 4090 VR gameplay performance I can max everything out on 2432x2432 resolution and can achieve a far more stable and consistent framerate which could be improved even further with a little more tinkering! Cyberpunk 2077 is an INSANE VR experience on this new PC...

I'll be running more RTX 4090 VR gaming tests over the next few weeks, please leave a comment down below if you'd like to see me test certain games or VR mods, I'm already keen to revisit the Resident Evil VR mods and performance hogs like Green Hell VR but feel free to recommend some more to me and I'll start working my way through them all.

The Nomad Camp was quiet as the sun began to set. People were starting to wind down for the night, gathering around a crackling campfire to listen to the soothing strumming of someone playing guitar.  I was getting ready to leave for Night City, my flying car revved up and ready to go.

As I soared through the sky, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the city below. I landed at the Gold Beach Marina parking lot and made my way to the nearest parking place for the Empathy Club.

The club was packed with people, their bodies moving in time with the music as they drank and partied. I weaved my way through the crowd, enjoying the vibrant energy of the city. Eventually, the night began to wind down, and I knew it was time to head back to my Japantown apartment.

I walked to the nearest Metro station, Republic Way, and hopped on the train, watching as the city blurred past me. When I arrived in Japantown, I walked through the bustling streets, taking in the neon lights and the sounds of people going about their lives.

Finally, I arrived at my apartment, exhausted but content. After taking a refreshing shower, I slipped into bed, feeling grateful for the adventures of the night and excited for whatever tomorrow would bring in Night City.

Quelle Chris - Obamacare | Official Video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-F19d5PcJY,Mello Music Group,Music,"['Quelle Chris', 'Obamacare', 'Mello Music Group', 'mello music group', 'hip hop', 'rap', 'new music', 'guns guns guns', 'chris keys', 'guns', 'chris', 'quelle', 'conscious rap', 'modern rap', 'cause rap', 'political hip hop', 'political', 'music', 'oakland', 'sean 5ill', 'healthcare', 'universal healthcare', 'music video', 'official music video']",2023-10-17T20:26:39.030Z,"From the Quelle Chris album ""Guns"" http://smarturl.it/GunsGunsGuns
Quelle says, “Obamacare came together just as organically as everything else on Guns. I’d been sitting on a few arrangements of two samples for a couple months. While in Oakland I was working with Chris Keys and Sean 5ill (Roger Billagio from Being You Is Great). Keys was doing an unintentional bit as an angry drum instructor that led to some amazing breaks. Once the drums existed the homeless samples basically feel into place. Keys then added his amazing piano but the real star of the song (besides my bars), the real cherry on top, the Vanjie Drag Race exit was the final edition. The bass line laid down by Keys. The rest is history. Plus I’d like to think of my music as free healthcare for all.”

Quelle adds, “Like most of my visuals I try to find the place where proper pairing and a good excuse to try my hand at something I always loved as a kid meet. The video for Obamacare is an homage to many of my favorite PBS, Sesame Street shorts with a touch of Terry Gilliam (and I mean a drip. Trust me I know my place. Lol). It’s one of my favorite songs on the album so I figured doing collage work in the style of my favorite era of animation was fitting. About 95% of the video was taken from the pages of archived magazines. Next video will likely be animatronics if this trend continues.”

Uh, if he fall on that floor, let him go, gone
Niggas ain't built for this page in my arc
All this Champagne put a stain on my heart
Don't pick him up, he ain't built for this part
If you wasn't here for them lows, walk
Blick on my hip and I'm dressed like a God
Labels like burners, just use 'em to toss
I take a shot and like Moses they part
Man, I can't tell what you mean (Huh)
Why does your black feel like business to me?
Industry lies never line up on screen (Facts)
Peggy keep scoring, I feel like the Dream
Yeah, what you want, ugh
Y'all love the fake, I've been real from the start
Never hesitate to shoot at a star
Stocked up on weapons and pussy and cars
Just thought you should know, ugh
Look at this lane that I made, it was vacant
These veggie grill niggas don't really want beef
Real niggas dying and fakers replace 'em
Now I see my DNA all in y'all beats
Talk, niggas just rap, don't back up what they talk
Pray for me, got so much smoke in my heart
Rap like I'm gifted and grew up on guard, yeah
Shorty want dick (What?), money, and leverage
One out of three, feel like three when I'm in it (Skrrt)
Peggy the G.O.A.T., more like the feds
As soon as you see me you know that it's finished
And, how can you tell that he's winnin'? (How?)
Floated right through the pandemic, no limits
Stunted creatively, don't got a vision
I die for my pride, you be hiding in gimmicks
Glock with a switch, turn a vegan to spinach (Brrt)
PM-50, we ain't beefin', you dinner
Turn a ""I'll do it"" right into ""Who did it?""
Some you can't speak, you should just buy a ticket
Choke 'em to death with the smoke from this fye
Giving these alt niggas hope when I die
Call up my mama then hang up the line (Bitch)
Money got me feelin' white like I'm Thai
Hawk!
When I go out tell 'em Peggy ain't give up, he fought, fuck 'em!

Dec. 6, 2019 | Abby O'Neill -- This Freddie Gibbs and Madlib Tiny Desk performance was a year in the making, largely because Madlib insisted on playing with El Michels Affair, a vintage funk and soul band based out of New York. But it was worth the wait. When pianist Marco Benevento opened with a delicate, almost jazzy run, it created the perfect opening — and juxtaposition — for hard-hitting emcee, Gibbs to jump in and ride the hell out of that beat.

From the moment they launched into ""Education,"" a cut off the latest MadGibbs project Bandana, it was obvious Gibbs has spent countless hours honing his style. Meanwhile, Madlib, an enigmatic and reclusive producer known for his analog head-nodders, brought along a small thunder tube and vintage electric bongos circa 1960. Just getting a chance to see him ignited excitement in the NPR crowd.

But the conclusive jam in this killer set was ""Freestyle S***,"" a track that drips with the smoothness of satin and swagger of the seventies. It and the rest of the set elevated the room for both longtime purists and new fans alike. But the way Gibbs emphatically showed his love for Madlib was just as beautiful to witness. There's little doubt about their deep admiration and appreciation for each other. It was hands down, for me, the best Tiny Desk of the year.

A modder named Set created this really awesome new shell for the Nintendo Switch OLED that makes it run way cooler!  The new shell turns the Switch into a dedicated home console, meaning you can no longer play it in handheld mode.  But the benefit of using this mod is you can keep the console cooler, even when it’s being overclocked.  So let's take a look at this shell and see why it's so awesome!

LYRICS / SUBTITLES
She picked one of my videos
So I picked Eminem My Name Is
And I was like that’s cool that she picked my video
I heard he’s married now
She heard a rumor that I was married and then said
The girl that he talks about killing on his record actually
And I was like no you didn’t just say that you little *****
Little ***** put me on blast on MTV
Yeah he’s cute but I think he’s married to Kim hee hee
And then she said yeah doesn’t he have a song about killing his baby’s mother
Girls out there don’t let a guy disrespect you
And I always tell my friends I’m so against domestic violence and if you’re in an abusive relationship and I was like why did she just pick my video if she’s picking it apart
She didn’t know if I was married or not she just heard a rumor and then put me on blast but I figured well **** it since she did that I’m gonna voice some rumors that I heard about you
Causing terror to Christina Aguilera when I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara

He sits down with the Warriors President and GM to discuss what his first love was: music or basketball, and if he truly believed he had a shot at the NBA. He explains why he didn’t need a Grammy for validation, why he lets very few people into his inner-circle and flashes back to when he used to smoke cigarettes as a six-year-old. He also talks about the times when he used to do a cypher every week. Full interview with Bob Myers here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9boVw2lnP5Q"

How to Build Your Ultimate Productivity System,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6hmdrsLQj8,Ali Abdaal,Education,"['Ali Abdaal', 'Ali abdal']",2023-10-15T04:09:16.266Z,"📚 Pre-order my book to get an exclusive ticket to The Feel-Good Productivity Annual Planning Workshop in January 2024! https://www.feelgoodproductivity.com/?utm_campaign=bonus&utm_source=youtube_long&utm_medium=video_description&utm_content=How+to+Build+the+Ultimate+Productivity+System+%282023%29

The whole point of a productivity system is to get your life in order and free up valuable brain space. No one wants to be spending tons of time organising emails or searching for a book quote that they forgot to highlight. 

There are broadly three levels of building an ultimate productivity system: keeping your life in order, capturing new info, and creating a system around it. You can stop at layer one or use all three. I cover it all in more detail in this video, including suggestions for apps that I like to use daily. 

00:00 Intro
01:37 Ron: keep your life in order
01:37 Calendar
04:21 Email
06:12 To-do list
09:06 File management
10:32 Hermoine: capture new information
11:09 Kindle
11:47 Read-it-later app

Interview w/ Jasper Hopkins

JPEGMAFIA caught up with Unity Radio's Breakfast Show host Jasper Hopkins 
for an interview before his sold-out show at the O2 Ritz in Manchester.

The interview started off with some wild tour stories, and then he let us know about how life is as a newly independent artist and his upcoming re-release of 'The Ghost Pop Tape'.

Peggy is renowned for his sample work, so he had to tell Jasper about some of the weirdest sounds he'd sampled to use in his tracks. 

After, Jasper wanted to know when the ""man-band"" Club Black Dust was getting in the studio together. The supergroup of JPEGMAFIA, Slowthai, Denzel Curry and Zillakami was announced in 2020 so JPEGMAFIA let us know when they're getting the band back together. 

JPEGMAFIA then shared his view of the current state of American hip-hop and then told us about his appreciation of Grime and the UK scene. 

To close off the interview, Jasper couldn't resist asking JPEGMAFIA about his long-standing feud with Morrissey. On Morrissey's home turf, Peggy challenged Morrissey to get in the ring with him.
JPEGMAFIA vs Morrissey in the ring in the Manchester Arena? Let's make it happen!

Vince then effortlessly dismantles the Kenny Beat and continues on with his life through the exit door of The Cave.

Written by Kelis and André 3000 who also served as the producer, the song was released in October 2004 as the third single from Kelis' third studio album, Tasty (2003).

Like Kelis' previous hit ""Trick Me"", it was released across the world, but not in the U.S. The track is built over an electro-space-funky R&B beat, derived from a sample of Doug E. Fresh and Slick Rick's 1985 song ""La Di Da Di"" who was well received by critics.

It became her third consecutive top three hit in the United Kingdom, and it managed to sell a final number 65,000 copies there.

The video, directed by Giuseppe Capotondi, does not feature Kelis or André 3000, and it instead has children playing the roles of young Kelis and André.

[Background talking]
(I know, I know but I gotta get up outta here,
You know, I gotta go pay these bills,
I got a show to do, you know?)

One time, for your mind.

[Chorus]
Let's go to sleep in Paris,
And wake up in Tokyo.
Have a dream in New Orleans,
Fall in love in Chicago,
Mayne.
Wherever I go she goes.

[Verse 1]
I love her
And I hate to leave her lonely
Ring ring went the Iphone, it was my homie
He said, ""let's hit Japan,
If we can make 'em jam,
We can make a hundred grand,
Spend it in the south of France
Nothing further."" I jumped,
Grabbed my go-yard trunk,
Got ready to 'walk it out,' like Unk
In my John Lennon chucks.
That's when I heard Murder
You're killin me, you're fillin me
With sorrow, sunrise, ""goobye""'s,
And ""missin you tomorrow""'s.
I turn to see my dream
Love supreme queen, meanest thing on the scene, cry.
I drop my bags in a flash
That's faster one A-T on that dash-er,
To dry your tears.
And wipe the rain from my dear like dash-er,
Use the dame who's the username to all my pass-words.
The reason I get fly as Ivan Jasp-er,
I even keep your picture in my pass-purt.
(love love)

[Chorus]
Let's go to sleep in Paris,
And wake up in Tokyo.
Have a dream in New Orleans,
Fall in love in Chicago,
Mayne.

Then we can land in the motherland,
Camelback across the desert sand.
Take a train, to Rome, or home,
Brazil, forreal.
Wherever I go she goes.
Wherever I go she goes.

[Verse 2]
So let's keep it, real,
All in't together, ""free chill!""
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie, on the reel.
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills,
Lean back in my first-class seat, and sleep.
Don't wake me till I land, when they barely understand
What I speak, but they nod to my beats.
I tell my fans who I am and they stand and they clap
They applaud. They love me, my God.
""O'scadie sama'desta"" or maybe ""au revoir,""
""A spree on Saint Henry,"" then back to Charles de Gaul.
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been,
And, everything that I done, and,
Tell her that she's the one, and, um.

[Chorus]
Let's go to sleep in Paris,
And wake up in Tokyo.
Have a dream in New Orleans,
Fall in love in Chicago,
Mayne.

Then we can land in the motherland,
Camelback across the desert sand.
Take a train, to Rome, or home,
Brazil, forreal.
Wherever I go she goes.
Wherever I go she goes.

[Verse 3]
Uh.
Guess who's back in the, house,
With a bunch of souvenirs, and a smile for your mouth.
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed you
In my dreams, 'fore I went to sleep, to La-La land to count them sheep.
I swear you're lookin prettier than ever,
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together ever more.
For better or, less or poor, all worth the wait in buried treasure
X's on the shore.
I know my world tour's like war to you,
But Ian said, ""Aloha,"" and Harley said, ""Cheers!""
Julian said, ""Bonjour!,"" Big O was like ""Yeahhhhh!""
Amanda and Lemessie want to know when we goin there.
Edison sends his love, so does the rest of the club
Of the international play-boys and play-yas.
But I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness,
She said, ""Pursue your interests, 'cause even If
I'm ticketless, I'll be there, by your side,
In your heart and, on your mind.""
So, as I taxi down another runway,
I Gotcha, who loves you 'bay?
Now bring it back, now, uh.

[Chorus]
Let's go to sleep in Paris,
And wake up in Tokyo.
Have a dream in New Orleans,
Fall in love in Chicago,
Mayne.

Then we can land in the motherland,
Camelback across the desert sand.
Take a train, to Rome, or home,
Brazil, forreal.
Wherever I go she goes.
Wherever I go she goes.

Wherever I go she goes.
Wherever I go she goes."

Lyrics:
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, NC, VA
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Oaktown, LA, San Fran, St. John
People give your ears, so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and the concubine
N*ggas, take off your coats ladies, act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically, I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, JB's on the promo
In my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers to invade the way
Hold up a second son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my sh*t is universal, if you got knowledge of dolo
Of delf for self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do do that that that (come on)
Do that, do that, do do that that that (okay)
Do that, do that, do do that that that
I'm bugging out, so let me get back 'cause I'm wettin' n*ggas
So run and tell the others 'cause we are the brothas
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas
Back in '89, I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So, Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phifer sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's the dance floor, come move that a*s
Non-believers, you can check the steps
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
N*ggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an over sized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want something here
Make something deffer, take that garbage to St. Elsewhere
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
S.C., Maryland, New Orleans, Motown
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Chinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
Houston, Delaware, DC, Dallas
We on a world tour with Muhammad, my man
Going each and every place with the mic in their hand
New York, NJ, N.C., VA"

Lyrics:

Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
I sip the Dom P, watching ""Gandhi"" 'til I'm charged
Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin' time like
Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timb's on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether crusing in a Sikh's cab, or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life (it's yours)
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches
Aiming guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-getting style, rolling foul
The versatile, honey-sticking wild golden child
Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days, for broke days we sell it, smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesus, soaking their sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction
How you living? Large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
You're flipping coke or playing spit, spades and strip poker?
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
Yo, the world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(It's yours)
Break it down
(It's yours)
(It's yours)
(It's yours)
(It's yours)
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, a thousand miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
'Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturing my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbing women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin', Big Willie-style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burning dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks with a bop, checking dames, plus the games
People play, bust the problems of the world today
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(It's yours)
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this? (Yeah)
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
(It's yours)
Break it down
Yeah, aight
To everybody in Queens, the foundation (it's yours)
The world is yours
To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours (it's yours)
The world is yours
To everybody in Brooklyn
Y'all know the world is yours (it's yours)
The world is yours
Everybody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours (it's yours)
Long Island, yo, the world is yours (it's yours)
Staten Island, yeah, the world is yours (it's yours)

I BET SHE TRIED TO SAY SHE GAVE ME HER ALL, SHE PLAYED BALL
ALL BETS OFF! THE VILLAIN GOT THE DICE RIGGED
AND THEY SAY HE ACCOSTED THE MAN WITH THE SLICED WIG
ALLEGEDLY; THE INVESTIGATION IS STILL ONGOING
IN THIS PESKY NATION HE GOTS THE BEST CON FLOWIN'
THE POT DOUBLES, NOW THEY REALLY GOT TROUBLES
MADMAN NEVER GO [POP] LIKE SNOT BUBBLES

Live on the first broadcast, we're joined by special guests Knxwledge and The Koreatown Oddity.""

A reupload of a longtime favorite. A special treat with some wild sounds and unmatched good vibes. Highly recommended in the morning. It's pretty loose, so I won't add any timestamps (yet), let me know your favorite moments!

🌞 Brace yourselves for a no-nonsense, Midwest Emo-Punk take on the legendary Arthur Theme Song! 🎸🎤

🌾 If you're not familiar with Midwest Emo, it's a genre that burst onto the scene in the American heartland during the late '90s and early 2000s. Expect heartfelt lyrics, gritty guitar riffs, and unapologetic vocals – that's the essence of Midwest Emo, and we're cranking it up a notch.

📺 Arthur, that cherished animated series from our childhoods, has never sounded quite like this before. I'm paying my respects by giving it a punk rock twist that'll hit you like a wave of nostalgia. 🐰📚

🎶 Grab a cold one, soak up the sun, and join me in celebrating the magic of Arthur with a Midwest Emo-Punk makeover that's destined to be your summer jam.

👊 If you dig this, don't forget to like, share, and subscribe to my channel. Comment below and tell me which classic you'd like to see me punkify next!

How to Build Your Ultimate Productivity System,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6hmdrsLQj8,Ali Abdaal,Education,"['Ali Abdaal', 'Ali abdal']",2023-10-14T17:48:42.881Z,"📚 Pre-order my book to get an exclusive ticket to The Feel-Good Productivity Annual Planning Workshop in January 2024! https://www.feelgoodproductivity.com/?utm_campaign=bonus&utm_source=youtube_long&utm_medium=video_description&utm_content=How+to+Build+the+Ultimate+Productivity+System+%282023%29

The whole point of a productivity system is to get your life in order and free up valuable brain space. No one wants to be spending tons of time organising emails or searching for a book quote that they forgot to highlight. 

There are broadly three levels of building an ultimate productivity system: keeping your life in order, capturing new info, and creating a system around it. You can stop at layer one or use all three. I cover it all in more detail in this video, including suggestions for apps that I like to use daily.

Converting an old Wii into an M1 Mac mini was the BEST IDEA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qOCjH2T7HQ,Luke Miani,Science & Technology,"['Mac mini', 'apple', 'tech', 'wii', 'vintage gaming', 'diy', 'project', 'console', 'Mac', 'apple silicon', 'Mac mini conversion']",2023-10-14T14:24:06.955Z,"Thanks to Pulseway for sponsoring!

It's no secret that the Mac mini design is a little bit stale. While everyone loves its price point, size, and performance, we aren't exactly excited by the little aluminum square anymore. Today that changes. The other day I was looking at an old Wii and I thought HMM, that looks like about the same size to me. What if I put a Mac mini in there? An Apple Silicon Wii?!? heck yeah! Today we'll build a DIY Mac mini Wii conversion perfect for retro gaming on a Mac. Wii games, Nintendo Gamecube, even PS2 emulation through Dolphin and Aethersx2 in the package of a Wii? Heck yeah!

Lyrics:
Staring contest with the sun
You’re not joking with me much 
These days it all just seems so rough
Maybe I haven’t been enough

Staring contest with the sun
We got used to having fun
These days it all just seems so dumb
Indifferent and numb

Drinking whiskey that you bought me
And I tried everything that you taught me
Piles of dirty laundry in my closet
These quarters in my pockets feel like rocks in a quarry

Staring contest with the moon
Wake up in the afternoon
These days I’m in a terrible mood
but I’ll always fake a smile for you

Staring contest with you in bed
Tracing your face in my head
These days I hate when you get upset
There’s nothing I can do about it

Drinking whiskey that you bought me
And I tried everything that you taught me
Piles of dirty laundry in my closet
These quarters in my pockets feel like rocks in a quarry

You’re not here but I’m
In your pocket
And you’re always on my mind

Caught in the corner of your eye

You’re not here but I’m
In your pocket
And you’re always on my mind

Caught in the corner of your eye
Like a picture in a locket
I’ll stare until I go blind"

How New York Chinatown Gangs Actually Work | How Crime Works | Insider,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2osXEixd3kM,Insider,Entertainment,['Insider'],2023-10-13T23:50:38.242Z,"Mike Moy says he was a gang member in New York City's Chinatown. He was recruited at his school's gates and then got involved in a gang in the 1970s. Moy claims he was involved in gambling houses, counterfeit money, bootleg kung fu movies, gunrunning, and credit-card fraud. He then joined the New York City Police Department as an officer in 1995 and worked there for 26 years.

Moy discusses the Chinatown gang's links with the Italian Mafia and how extortion worked. He talks about the locations of safe houses in Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, and the secret smuggling tunnels around the city.

Moy founded the YouTube channel Chinatown Gang Stories, where he speaks with former gang members about their lives. Find more of Moy's interviews here:

And Starfield reviews reflect that. Because Starfield gameplay is textbook Bethesda and the ultimate space exploration game is usually thought of as a space simulator like No Man's Sky. But Starfield is not a space exploration sim. It's Fallout 3 in space with a splash of Oblivion for good measure. And I love this... but it took a minute to get over the cognitive dissonance.

The Nomad Camp was quiet as the sun began to set. People were starting to wind down for the night, gathering around a crackling campfire to listen to the soothing strumming of someone playing guitar.  I was getting ready to leave for Night City, my flying car revved up and ready to go.

As I soared through the sky, the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the city below. I landed at the Gold Beach Marina parking lot and made my way to the nearest parking place for the Empathy Club.

The club was packed with people, their bodies moving in time with the music as they drank and partied. I weaved my way through the crowd, enjoying the vibrant energy of the city. Eventually, the night began to wind down, and I knew it was time to head back to my Japantown apartment.

I walked to the nearest Metro station, Republic Way, and hopped on the train, watching as the city blurred past me. When I arrived in Japantown, I walked through the bustling streets, taking in the neon lights and the sounds of people going about their lives.

Finally, I arrived at my apartment, exhausted but content. After taking a refreshing shower, I slipped into bed, feeling grateful for the adventures of the night and excited for whatever tomorrow would bring in Night City.

Lyrics

And you don't seem to understand
A shame you seemed an honest man
And all the fears you hold so dear
Will turn to whisper in your ear
And you know what they say might hurt you
And you know that it means so much
And you don't even feel a thing

I am falling
I am fading
I have lost it all

And you don't seem the lying kind
A shame that I can read your mind
And all the things that I read there
Candlelit smile that we both share
And you know I don't mean to hurt you
But you know that it means so much
And you don't even feel a thing

I am falling
I am fading
I am drowning
Help me to breathe
I am hurting
I have lost it all
I am losing
Help me to breathe

I am falling
I am failing
I am drowning
Help me to breathe
I am hurting
I have lost it all
I am losing
Help me to breathe

I am falling
I am failing
I am drowning
Help me to breathe
I am hurting
I have lost it all
I am losing
Help me to breathe

The Legion 5 Pro has received a lot of interest in the past few months. It has a powerful GPU (NVIDIA RTX 3070), powerful CPU (Ryzen 7 5800H), and can show off good battery life. However, I find it chunky, not very styled, and a little on the heavy side. But the performance really stands out, especially with 3D modeling. So I can see where the draw comes from for this laptop.

The Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 and HP Omen are well suited for 4k video editing, design, photo-editing, 3D modeling, After Effects, and more!

I'm sharing a few tips and tricks from personal experience making music with the most basic setup ever. I used one mic, an interface, a laptop and the free sounds and plugins on Logic Pro.

The track I'm using to show some examples is Wild Card, off my last EP. If you wanna hear it, links below!

All the background music was also made by me with the processes explained in this vid, all free Logic sounds and audio effects.

CORRECTION at 2:32 Oops actually Reaper is not free, you can get it as cheap as $60 after the trial period, but many keep the trial period forever which is why everyone says it's free :S

I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight

And you take the time to make sure that I'm okay
I know I can put stress on your brain
You still love me, put no one above me
You always go out of your way
To show me that I'm your priority

- ABOUT THIS VIDEO - 
In this video, I talk about the rise of the streamer Destiny (Steven Bonnell II) the grandfather of the Twitch Politics space, and the creator of the DGG community. I explain the Destiny Iceberg, Tier 1 being a brief introduction to Bonnell, Tier 2 explaining some of his most memorable moments such as the ""What is an NFT?"" moment with Saint and The Sinner, his debate with Jesse Lee Peterson, and his career in Star-Craft 2. Tier 3 talks about Destiny on the Rajj Royale & the eventual Bob7 drama with Melina & BigBossBoze. It also covers Hasan Piker & August, the editor of Destiny. Tier 4 covers The Cuties Guy (mrgirl), LavLune & the infamous DDOS kid. Tier 5 covers the Denims drama with Atlas & LittleeFox, and the WhiteNervosa DGG clone websites while Tier 6 covers DJWheat's drama with Destiny, the mysterious case of MrMouton & a Star-Craft 2 catfish gone terribly wrong. This is the Destiny Iceberg.

lyrics:
My favorite poem was the one I read to you
From the teleprompter on the tongue of my shoe
My flashbacks are a touch more resolute
Declaring thumb wars in the pocket of my suit

Take it
Take it all down, take me all apart
You can have my tongue just promise you’ll take it a la carte yeah
Take it all, just don’t take it all to heart
Thank God we turned the lights off, thank God

Take it, uh
Take me all apart
You can have my tongue just promise you’ll take it a la carte
Take it all, just don’t take it all to heart
Thank God we turned the lights off, thank God

And what I never knew
I’d rather be inside my head than you
How many times? Well I couldn’t count
Cause it gets so deep, it goes so deep I’m never pulling out

NYC on a red eye free cause they wanna take this and that
LLC for the next LP and I’m never gonna give it back
Sleep deprived on my return flight, fixated bout my hold on you
I don’t usually care for the doom in the air but it’s feeling kinda overdue, yeah

My favorite poem’s what I couldn’t say to you
The joke that wasn’t funny cause it’s true
My flashbacks are a touch more resolute
So forgive me for the hesitant salute

Take it
Take it all down, take me all apart
You can have my tongue if you take it a la carte
Take it all, just don’t take it all to heart
Thank God we turned the lights off, thank God

Uh, and what I never knew
I’d rather be inside my head than you
How many times? I couldn’t count
Cause it gets so deep I go so deep I’m never pulling out

(brakence)
Took you south,
Guess I got my jaw agape now I’m a cotton mouth,
Why do I feel so unsafe? What am I worried bout
Got a sedated sipping 80 proof
Skip the winter season like it’s pay-per-view
It ain’t you, I’m just caught up in my own sh*, licking wounds
I know it isn’t state of the art but the plate’s a la carte
Would you like course two?
(I don’t really think I’m perfect)
And what I never knew
(I don’t really think I’m, I don’t really think I’m perfect)
Could-could I be inside my head with you?
Freaked out tryna f*** you right
I know you never grade looks, still feel like a five,
But you said if we make love and I start to cry that
I can let it all out, shouldn’t rationalize but
God damn,
Do I deserve that you can’t hear me now?
It just gets so deep, and it goes so deep now that I’m peering down

My favorite poem was the one I read to you,
On the tongue of my shoe
Flashbacks are a touch more resolute
So forgive me
So please forgive me ohhh
Take me all apart
You can have my tongue if you take it a la carte
Take it all, just don’t take it all to heart"

""The first time I ever really listened to Kyle Kulinski’s show was in the back of a cab last summer. The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers — loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.

“Do you like Kyle Kulinski?”

The driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.

“He understands what we’re up against,” Ahmed said. “Like Bernie.”

But I was surprised to hear Kulinski’s name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski’s show struck me as mostly capital-P “progressive” takes on the news — the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.

It’s an impression that wasn’t entirely incorrect.

“I have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,” Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. “I don’t want to hear about Lenin. I don’t want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.”

With over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do — even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski’s.

While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski’s fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he’s closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.

But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks — who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago — the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on “the Millennial Left” pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski’s name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of “the Squad” to power.

Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? “There is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,” according to one moderator. In new media, he’s king — the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he’s nobody.

I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing “cool” about Kulinski’s show. (As a friend put it, “‘Welcome to Secular Talk’ sounds like something you’d hear on Egyptian radio.”) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won’t get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as “Dirtbag Left.” Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. “Not only have I not attended one,” he says, “I have no idea what that means.”

And yet he’s astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan’s wildly popular show, introduced them. “You make the most sense to me,” Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. “You’re a normal person.”

Much like Sanders himself, Kulinski’s show has a massive audience that just doesn’t compute with our media’s understanding of “what the kids want” or even “what the left-wing kids want.”

It’s probably for the best — the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. “Corporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all — class issues,” he said on a recent episode.

04:45 - Higher Order Thinking Skills
09:00 - Non-Linear Note Taking

You know how there’s always that ONE student, who never seems to study yet passes with flying colours? How do they do it? Are they... More talented? Smarter? Or... maybe they just have really good study notes? 

There are effective and ineffective methods of note-taking, which result in vastly different outcomes. Some note-taking methods result in low retention of the notes and a lower depth or mastery of content. Unfortunately, most people who adopt these less efficient methods think that QUANTITY will get them to their desired goal, but it rarely ever does. 

At the same time, some note-taking methods result in WAYY more effective learning. Working on the technique and execution of the technique means greater progress in LESS time. 

So, what makes certain methods of note-taking more effective than others?

There’s one key principle that has consistently been proven to make note-taking and learning in general more efficient, and it’s an idea called higher-order thinking skills (HOTS)

My videos eventually get ads. I don't make any money off of these, it's all monetized due to copyright.

Three ways to fix this are―
1) Go to the end of the video and replay, so it thinks you've already listened to it
2) Go to youtubeloop.net so it can play with no ads
3) Use a real good adblocker

None of this music is mine, all of the credit goes to their rightful owners. I don't, nor will ever, claim to own the rights to any songs, gifs, or photos used in my videos. I make my videos for entertainment purposes only.

Fix Stereo Audio - All Sound Is Mono (Windows Left/Right Doesn't Work),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6LSVJCFvlg,MDTechVideos,Science & Technology,"['dell', 'hp', 'acer', 'toshiba', 'lenovo', 'tablet', 'laptop', 'windows 11', 'stereo audio windows 11', 'stereo audio windows 11 not working left right sound not working laptop speakers not working', 'dell laptop speakers not working', 'Lenovo laptop speakers not working', 'laptop external speakers not working', 'windows 11 laptop speakers not working', 'Toshiba laptop speakers not working', 'hp laptop speakers not working', 'laptop not detecting speakers', 'laptop speakers not loud enough', 'fix laptop speakers not working']",2023-10-09T15:05:15.095Z,"Fix Stereo Audio - All Sound Is Mono (Windows Left/Right Doesn't Work).

Most audio you listen to is in “stereo”, which means that different things are played in through both the left and right speakers. However, you can have your PC mix the sound to mono, playing everything combined through both speakers.

This would allow you to use just one earbud with your PC, but still hear both the left and right audio tracks. It’s also very helpful if you have trouble hearing through one ear.

Issues addressed in this tutorial: 
stereo audio windows 11
stereo audio windows 11 not working
left right sound not working
laptop speakers not working
dell laptop speakers not working
Lenovo laptop speakers not working
laptop external speakers not working
windows 11 laptop speakers not working
Toshiba laptop speakers not working
hp laptop speakers not working
laptop not detecting speakers
laptop speakers not loud enough
fix laptop speakers not working

Windows 11 has been prone to producing grotesque and equally unexpected errors for users. Among many cumbersome abnormalities, many HP users have found it difficult to get stereo output from their analogical headphones that use 3.5mm jacks on their windows 11 operating systems. This particular issue is not solved by upgrading to the latest Realtek or HP drivers. Temporary workarounds like uninstalling the default speakers/headphones and rebooting with the headphones plugged in are…temporary. Soon as Windows installs a new update, the problem will start to appear again. The problem, difficult to diagnose and debug as it may seem, isn’t impossible to solve.

Sometimes you may notice an unbalance in the left and right audio balance of a playback (output) device such as a speaker or headphone, and may need to manually adjust the left and right audio balance level until it sounds best to you.

This tutorial will show you how to adjust the left and right audio balance level of sound playback devices in Windows 11.

This tutorial will apply for computers, laptops, desktops, and tablets running the Windows 11 operating system (Home, Professional, Enterprise, Education) from all supported hardware manufactures, like Dell, HP, Acer, Asus, Toshiba, Lenovo, Huawei and Samsung."

They require regular grooming to maintain their coat and to prevent matting. The reaction of a Pomeranian to grooming may vary depending on the individual dog and their past experiences with grooming. Some Pomeranians may enjoy the attention and feel relaxed during grooming sessions, while others may become anxious or stressed. It's important to approach grooming sessions with patience and positive reinforcement to help the dog associate grooming with positive experiences.
It's also important to start grooming at a young age so they can get used to it, and gradually introduce them to different types of grooming tools.

Head over to https://nebula.tv/videos/neurotransmissions-why-i-stopped-watching-football

Are you a football fan? So was I. But a few years ago, I learned some things that totally changed my mind. Football fans everywhere are prepping for the Super Bowl - the Big Game - but I’ll be sitting on the sidelines for this one and I can’t bring myself to participate in the NFL festivities, even if it can be very fun. The reason? I discovered so many awful truths about football (and contact sports in general) and their relationship with concussions, dementia, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. It was enough to turn me off of football, even as a native Wisconsinite and huge Packers fan. I hope you’ll hear me out and make up your own mind. And be warned that this episode contains some heavy stuff, including depictions of serious bodily harm and discussion of injury and death.

Perpetually updated version here: https://nebula.tv/videos/todd-in-the-shadows-songs-that-stop-on-the-word-stop-supercut-deluxe

Ground rules: If there was even the briefest of stops, I counted it. It's okay if the band holds the note rather than complete silence. But the entire band has to stop, not just a couple instruments; the singer can keep singing though.

This was compiled through months of research and extensive crowdsourcing. If you ever left a comment suggesting a song and it wound up in this video, it was probably your suggestion that did it.

in this video, conure will be reacting to the new veridis joe video ""i love fighting transphobic radical twitter feminists"" about their experiences getting mobbed on twitter by terfs for postinga picture with their partner not looking ""queer enough."" they will be talking about stuff like the relative minor importance of such an issue in today's society, how heterosexuality intersects with other queer identities like trans, intersex, and asexual, people who don't conform to queer stereotypes, parallels between race and gender identity when it comes to erasure, gatekeeping and how people will try to invalidate the identity of queer people, why gender abolitionism is good for breaking down the labels and stereotypes people use against lgbtq people, cis passing and straight passing people in the lgbt community, why homophobes don't like queer people who don't conform to their stereotypes, intersectional feminism and how it explains the different ways out white supremacist society impacts the lives of black and brown queer folx, how to determine what is and isn't a slur, anonymous profiles on twitter calling other people ugly, and much more!

At ten o'clock, ten lions came to the market and Shi went to the market. Looking at the ten lions, he relied on his arrows to cause the ten lions to pass away. Shi picked up the corpses of the ten lions and took them to his stone room. The stone room was damp. Shi ordered a servant to wipe the stone room.

Read description for plot update!
First, go show some love to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utYanxGgTww
Don't spread hate.
Unfortunately the legendary comment thread has been deleted due to the closing of Prolitening's previous school account. Nevertheless, please go support his new channel!


I also thank the lord Jesus Charlie himself for blessing this video https://youtu.be/foSAi-olfck

For those who are wondering, the plot had achieved a *good ending* status. Try to find Hen\*ai guy’s comment in Cr1tikal’s video. We’re basically married now.

My idea of mediocrity is that it had room for improvement, it was not bad. Wasn’t trying to insult the performance, just an honest opinion. Obviously could have worded that better though! Prolitening told me he understood my intentions were not hostile, so we pals now. Stay tuned for potential collab!

Edit 2: The potential collab is happening! Come check out the Ultimate Rush E for 8 hands! Featuring @litening5826, @TheMeeksDuo, and myself!

Spoiler alert: no, but let's talk about why.

Rush E is one of the internet's latest hot topics, but how does Fanchen go about playing this arrangement and how does he make it musical? And beyond that, what can you take from this technical performance and implement it into your own?

Big ups to @Fanchen  and his playing and for sending me the sheets! Go listen to his original performance and support the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on4IoQ2MQ7M

JumpStart Adventures 3rd Grade: Mystery Mountain Walkthrough (Robots 1-5),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ-kS_GeSOI,Mr. Eight-Three-One,Gaming,[''],2023-10-07T04:44:55.083Z,"Now here's something I haven't done yet -- a walkthrough of a JumpStart game! Personally, I remember very little of this series growing up; the only two games I played were Kindergarten (the classic one) and Reading for 1st Graders. So, why did I make this, exactly? I had been seeing various videos of this game across YouTube and was very intrigued by it. I came across a boxed copy of the game on eBay for a really good price as well. How could I resist? 

This is going to be split up in five parts due to how obscenely long this game is. There was absolutely no chance I was ever going to be able to fit this entire game into one part anyway -- pretty sure the game runs above 12 hours anyway, which is the longest you are allowed to upload. This walkthrough was recorded off v1.1 of this game, which has a few sound-related alterations compared to v1.0 and is also the first to include the shortened opening (so, unfortunately, no mention of the extra credit question...for shame!). This was recorded off Windows 95 in DOSBox, as I wanted to have the OPL3 MIDI to set this apart from the other videos of this game on YouTube (they usually use Windows MIDI). I set all the games to the highest difficulty where it was applicable for not only the obvious reason of me being far above the target demographic, but also because the games give you a lot more invention points if you do so. Generally, if you play on Level 3 on all of the games, you never have to farm for more points. More on the games themselves (in order of when they were first played):

Painting Gallery: I have to wonder why they even bothered with this. There's almost no educational value to this game and you just have to follow Polly's stupidly easy instructions to win it.

Shrinking Room: People love to complain how ""slow"" this game is…umm, the difficulties aren't just there to look pretty! Seriously, set it to Level 3, and this game gets infinitely more tolerable. I like this one alright, though the last level design you see in this video drives me bonkers -- I had to cut down most of it because almost all of it was spent just trying to get Botley into the stupid portal. Also, you can tell they didn't anticipate people setting it to level 3 -- the glitchiness really starts to shine. Still, I really enjoy this one. I have a few dumb moments in this video, but I think it went alright.

Biosphere: I'm going to let you know now I'm not very intelligent when it comes to Earth science, so don't expect me to get everything on my first try. Also, if you're wondering how I signal for help on the biomes being correct or not, you can press the space bar and the game will basically outright tell you if you're in the right place or not. They frustratingly never tell you this unless you press the help button while you're in the biomes, which is annoying as I would have liked to have known it a lot earlier.

Observatory: This one is really boring. The radio wave part is easily won, the sentence section takes forever despite being overly easy, and if you know nothing on astronomy like me, the telescope part is a nightmare. I don't even try finding the right constellation; I just keep getting it wrong enough times until Botley tells you the answer. It's either that or listen to every long description until you blindly hope to find the right one.

Wheel of Invention: I don't know why there's a long pause between every question. Like I said though, I didn't want to interrupt the music so I just left it as it was. Not much else to say.

Kitchen: On Level 3 the only thing that really annoys me is the odd molecule measurements, but it's a fairly easy game otherwise. Math is my strong subject anyway so this was never troubling for me.

Maze: Everyone seems to hate this game. I love it. Of course, that may just be my engineer mind. I'm not really a fan of how you can't tell where teleporters take you unless you actually try them though - they needed a way to indicate where a teleporter exit was. Since this one usually takes a lot of time to finish, especially on Level 3, I'll probably be editing parts where all I do is think in later videos.

Virtual Collection: I have to be honest, I had never gotten a math based puzzle on my first playthrough of this game, so it took me by surprise to see it here. Not that I'm complaining, as I am a math person after all. I really like this one primarily for its music, though the puzzle is also fun to do.

Generator: This one always makes me nervous because they go to great lengths to make you feel like you're in a hurry. But that's exactly why I love this one. I had a brainfart with one equation but otherwise it went well.

Music Hall: Not much to say here."

pros:

this board looks p clean
sounds very nice with case foam
very budget-friendly
small board; saves space on your desk

cons:

40% layout; harder to use but i adjusted within 4 days
lots of soldering (it's really not bad, just be careful)
no real case, just a top and bottom plate with a pcb and standoffs
floating keycap design (idk if this is a con, but i'm not too big of a fan of this design, but on this board, i don't mind)"

What is this clip from? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCQoukZvvFo (0:55 - 1:20)
Who is this guy?

Hi there! I am glad that we both enjoy Osho quotes. In order to preserve the historical and comedic value of the clip, I refrained from adding in-video commentary. Instead, I will explain this clip here, in the video description.

This clip features Osho, an Indian spiritual teacher who was born as Rajneesh Chandra Mohan in 1931 and passed away in 1990. He is considered one of the most controversial spiritual teachers of the 20th century, known for his revolutionary teachings that combined Eastern spirituality and Western individualism.
Osho's teachings emphasized the importance of meditation, mindfulness, and self-discovery as a means to achieving spiritual liberation. He encouraged his followers to embrace their desires and to challenge societal norms, which sometimes led to criticism and controversy.

Despite the controversy surrounding Osho and his communes, his teachings continue to inspire many people around the world. He is regarded as one of the most innovative spiritual teachers of the 20th century, and his books on spirituality, meditation, and personal growth remain popular. Osho's legacy is also reflected in the growth of meditation and mindfulness practices in the Western world, and his teachings continue to influence new generations of spiritual seekers.

The clip is from one of Osho's televised speeches, and his dynamic speaking style and thought-provoking ideas helped to popularize his teachings and encourage people to seek their own truth. His talks covered a wide range of topics including spirituality, religion, philosophy, psychology, and politics.

In conclusion, Osho's teachings continue to inspire and influence people around the world, and his legacy is reflected in the growth of meditation and mindfulness practices in the Western world. This clip is just a small part of his many dynamic and thought-provoking speeches, which continue to be widely available today.

This clip was from   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCQoukZvvFo  (0:55 - 1:20), one of Osho's televised speeches from 1981. I highly recommend checking out the OSHO International channel and the 2018 series, ""Wild Wild Country"" for more content on Osho!"

""On January 2, 2007 Daxflame was created on Youtube through a series of video vlogs and Video Diary entries that centered around a 15-year-old boy with little to no social skills made by username Daxflame http://www.youtube.com/user/Daxflame. The videos gained momentum as more people began watching the poor, awkward boy on Youtube. Most of his videos consist of him talking about his “girlfriends” and his best friend “Jacob” as well ad other day-to-day occurrences. Known in the videos as Bernice Jauch the III, he is called the king of socially awkward boys on the web, thanks to his weezy voice, form of dressing, and over-reactions to things. The Youtube community quickly got on to make fun of Daxflame and the meme was born."" - Knowyourmeme

If you have it different than me, it doesn't mean that I'm a fake. It just means that you have it different than me. I have it very often and it's very rare someone is able to get me out of it. If you also have SP, I'm sorry for what you have to go through. Also, don't forget to hug your Grandma.

*EDIT 5/4/23*

It seems like the algorithm got this video. It's getting 50k views a day at the time of writing this when it used to get a couple of hundred a day. 

I am now 30 years old and I still suffer from sleep paralysis. If you look at my pinned comment from last year, I logged my sleep paralysis and got it over 75 times in 2022. Thats one episode of sleep paralysis for every 4 days of that year. That is an average year for me. I've had it since the first time I could remember at the age of 5. This video is not monetized and no, I didn't ""fake"" this for self attention. Again, it's impossible to twitch my neck like that when I'm not in SP. I am, however glad this is getting attention to spread awareness to this horrible sleeping disorder. I hope someday that there will be a cure. If any media outlets want to use this video, I'll sign off on any forms, just as I have before. Find a way to contact me (check my other videos). Thanks for all the comments, I'm sorry I can't get to all of them. I'm getting dozens an hour at this point. Be well, don't forget to hug your grandma."

What you're witnessing is a video being copied to a VHS tape, that tape being re-digitized, and then copied onto the tape again... and again and again and again... a total of sixteen times.

I termed the original digital video source ""generation 1"", but it should possibly be called ""generation 0"". I've never been clear on which way is proper. The first time you see VHS is generation 2.

Results vary from VCR to VCR. This one behaved nicely.

I made sure to start out with a very colorful scene in order to show how the colors degraded.

Because of YouTube's current video compression data rate bottleneck, there isn't a good way to upload videos with this much difference from frame to frame while maintaining decent resolution.

🟡 · Spoiler Level ·
I touch on the complete Splatoon story up to 2022 in this video. While it is full of spoilers, I’d still consider it safe to watch without playing the games, even if you’re planning on playing them. A lot of the story is time-based and having plot details spoiled for you will barely impact any future experience you might have with it.

In this video, I do a demonstration with a few of the components of my study system. Using this system, I was able to study for my Master's semester in about 1/6th of the normal estimated time. I was able to achieve High Distinction and my work was categorised as an exemplar.

The focus is on creating that high quality encoding which forms that stable foundation for future learning.

I demonstrate the use of ""chunking"" which is shown to bypass working memory capacity limitations and how this integrates with ""chunkmapping"", the variation of mindmapping that I teach. There are also a number of other techniques that I use, which other videos will individually focus on, but this shows an overview of how the system can come together.

The key areas of challenge for beginners doing this are:
- Insecurity at not writing so many notes
- Insecurity at not writing linear notes
- Discomfort from the chunking and encoding process (cognitive load which you may not be used to) - this discomfort can be misinterpreted as bad, whereas it can actually be the total opposite, where the normal, passive learning which was very comfortable was just a waste of time.
- Proper chunkmapping technique
- Evaluating the quality of chunks and chunk structures
- Breaking framing bias when doing syntopical reading

I will endeavour to cover each of these in other videos to come.

If you enjoyed what I had to give or found it valuable, a subscribe would be sincerely appreciated.

NewJeans are the first group to launch from ADOR, HYBE’s independent label led by Min Hee-Jin. Through their truthful and authentic music that evidence youthful spirits, the five-member act (MINJI HANNI, DANIELLE, HAERIN and HYEIN) aspires to elevate K-pop to new heights by pushing the boundaries of the existing K-pop scene.

Born and raised in East Atlanta, Grammy nominated J.I.D grew up on his parents’ collection of classic funk/soul LPs, and broke onto the scene with his 2015 EP, DiCaprio. The EP saw him collaborating with hip-hop duo EARTHGANG, whom he’d previously joined on a 2014 tour. Spotted here by J.Cole, J.I.D was promptly signed to Dreamville/Interscope Records. J.I.D’s nimble, head-nodding lyricism and lightning fast flow has awarded him a loyal and cult-like fanbase and his dedication to perfecting the art is sportsman-like, leaving room for him to be one of rap’s greatest in the making. 

LYRICS:
정말 짜릿했어 어디선가
내게 윙크한 까만 눈동자
Boy, your beautiful eyes got me lost now, yeah
깜짝 놀라게 하기는 해도
자신만만한 너의 그 태도
Liked you from the get go
Cool함은 그대로 부담감은 '제로'
'Cause you know you're sparkling like a shooting star
I can see us going far
얼마나 상큼할까
We will pop up all around the world
마법 같은 걸 I'm ready, let's go
You already know
That I don't ever want us to be
I don't ever want us to be
I don't ever want us to be apart
I don't ever want us to be
I don't ever want us to be apart
코카콜라 맛있다
코카콜라 맛있다
See you looking, catch it

사실 궁금했어
저기선가 내 눈에 띄던 까만 네 글자
Boy, your stylish glow up got me hooked now, yeah
살짝 짓궂게 보이긴 해도
완전 달달한 너의 그 애교
Liked you from the get go
Sweet함은 그대로
불안감은 '제로'
'Cause you know you're sparkling like a shooting star
I can see us going far
얼마나 상큼할까
We will pop up all around the world
마법 같은 걸 I'm ready, let's go
You already know
That I don't ever want us to be
I don't ever want us to be
I don't ever want us to be apart
I don't ever want us to be

I never ever ever want for us to be apart,
thats a fear puppeteer pull the strings to my heart,
very serious severely sitting here inside the dark
cuz whenever u depart or disappear I feel parched..
all around the world I wonder where u are,
what u doin,
who u hanging wit,
prolly wit the stars at a party,
U the main event,
they the undercard,
life changing let em take a sip they be back tomorrow,
shame shame I’m still hanging with the same and lane changing in da range,
da black seats and cream guts bout to spill my drank,
gas station fill my tank,
rollin rollin candy paint,
right inside the cup holder trying to ignore da phone ranging,
JID a Buffalo soldier my mama told me bout da game,
never cared about the fame but now da whole world know my name,
now I’m off the road I made my quota no we ain’t da same,
if yeen notice,
chilling really but who the coldest
코카콜라 맛있다
코카콜라 맛있다
See you looking, catch it
